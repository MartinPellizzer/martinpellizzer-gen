    "intro": "Descurainia erodiifolia, commonly known as hoary dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, roots, and chlorophyll. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and can be a nuisance to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it has limited ecological benefits but plays a role in certain ecosystems."
