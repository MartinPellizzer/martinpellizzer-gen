It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and long, tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into cylindrical, yellowish fruits. Its tubers are often used as a food source in some cultures, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
