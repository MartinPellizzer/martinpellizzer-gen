    "intro": "Dryopteris nitens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the forest floor. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its distinctive growth pattern."
