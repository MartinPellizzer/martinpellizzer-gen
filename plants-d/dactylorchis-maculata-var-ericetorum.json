    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata var. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Dactylorchis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in forested areas, often near Ericaceae species such as heather and blueberries. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack showy petals, instead displaying intricate, spurred labellum structures. It is a rare and specialized orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological niche."
