    "intro": "Dracula microglochin, commonly known as the miniature vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble tiny, ghostly faces, giving it its hauntingly beautiful appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, including high altitude and shade. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Dracula microglochin is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for its preservation."
