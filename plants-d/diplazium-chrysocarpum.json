    "intro": "Diplazium chrysocarpum, commonly known as the golden-fruited water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's ability to tolerate stagnant water makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
