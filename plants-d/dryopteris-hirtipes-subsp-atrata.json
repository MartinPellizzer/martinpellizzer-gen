    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtipes subsp. atrata, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern."
