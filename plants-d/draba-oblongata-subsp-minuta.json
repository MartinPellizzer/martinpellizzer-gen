    "intro": "Draba oblongata subsp. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
