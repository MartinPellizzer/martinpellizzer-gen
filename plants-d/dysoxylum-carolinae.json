    "intro": "Dysoxylum carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina satinwood, is a tropical tree species native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
