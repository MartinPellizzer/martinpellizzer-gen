It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
