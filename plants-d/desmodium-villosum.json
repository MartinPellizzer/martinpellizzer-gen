    "intro": "Desmodium villosum, commonly known as hairy desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, cylindrical pods, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Desmodium villosum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
