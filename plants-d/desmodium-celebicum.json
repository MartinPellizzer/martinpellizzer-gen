    "intro": "Desmodium celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Desmodium celebicum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
