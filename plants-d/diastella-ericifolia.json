    "intro": "Diastella ericifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Diastella ericifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall."
