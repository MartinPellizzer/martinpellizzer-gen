    "intro": "Dieffenbachia herthae, commonly known as the Hertha's corn plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive white and green variegation pattern. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia herthae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
