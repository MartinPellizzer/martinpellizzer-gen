    "intro": "Dryptopetalum, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant typically features tall, erect stems with showy, often fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Dryptopetalum species are found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in wetland or marshy habitats. Their unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make them an important subject in botanical studies."
