    "intro": "Drosera lowriei, commonly known as the Lowrie's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with small, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces white or pink flowers during the summer months, and its growth is often influenced by seasonal rainfall patterns. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
