    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold and waterlogged conditions, making it a key component of boreal and temperate wetlands."
