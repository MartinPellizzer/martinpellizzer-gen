It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Diasperus benguelensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
