    "intro": "Diplazium croatianum, commonly known as the Croatian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water."
