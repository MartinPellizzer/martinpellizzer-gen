It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically features trifoliate leaves with slender, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
