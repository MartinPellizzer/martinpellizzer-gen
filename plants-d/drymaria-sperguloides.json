    "intro": "Drymaria sperguloides, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, pale green to silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and rocky habitats. Silverweed is often found in dry, open areas such as meadows, fields, and along roadsides."
