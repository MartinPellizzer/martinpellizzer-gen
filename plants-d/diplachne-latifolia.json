    "intro": "Diplachne latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in panicles. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne latifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
