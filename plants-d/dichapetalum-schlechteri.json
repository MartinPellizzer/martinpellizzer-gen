It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, showy, white or pale pink flower that resembles a star. The plant has a short, stocky stem and broad, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its unique floral structure and adaptation to harsh environments make it a notable species in botanical studies."
