    "intro": "Dryopteris subintegriloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
