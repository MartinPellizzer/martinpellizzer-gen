It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
