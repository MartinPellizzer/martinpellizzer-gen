    "intro": "Dendrobium leucohybos, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching growth habit with smooth, dark green pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes in tropical and subtropical regions."
