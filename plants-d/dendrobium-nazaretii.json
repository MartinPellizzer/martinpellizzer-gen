    "intro": "Dendrobium nazaretii, commonly known as the Nazareth orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blooms are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight pink or red hue. Dendrobium nazaretii prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
