    "intro": "Drepanostemma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it often grows in disturbed soils and open areas. Drepanostemma species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may behave as annuals depending on the climate. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
