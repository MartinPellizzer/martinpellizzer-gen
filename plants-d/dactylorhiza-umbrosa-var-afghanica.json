The plant produces tall, slender stems with several oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
