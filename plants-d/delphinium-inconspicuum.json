    "intro": "Delphinium inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of a fibrous network. Delphinium inconspicuum is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
