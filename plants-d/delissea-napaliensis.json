    "intro": "Delissea napaliensis, commonly known as the Napali delissea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in moist, shaded forest areas."
