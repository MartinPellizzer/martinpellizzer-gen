    "intro": "Draba lactea f. tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender milkweed draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate in shape and are covered with a milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Draba. This variety is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Draba lactea."
