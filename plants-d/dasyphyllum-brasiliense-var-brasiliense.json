    "intro": "Dasyphyllum brasiliense var. brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually pale green or white. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument making, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its conservation status as vulnerable."
