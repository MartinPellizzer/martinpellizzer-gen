    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. madrasensis, commonly known as the Madras maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its spread. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
