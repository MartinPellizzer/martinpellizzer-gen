    "intro": "Dendrobium dedeksantosoi, commonly known as the Dedeksa Santos orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, producing white to pale yellow blossoms with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
