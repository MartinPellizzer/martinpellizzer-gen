    "intro": "Dryopteris schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
