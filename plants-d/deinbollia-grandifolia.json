    "intro": "Deinbollia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved bignay, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, and tart fruits resembling small, round berries. Deinbollia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
