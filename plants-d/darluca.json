    "intro": "Darluca, commonly known as the moonflower, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, opening in response to darkness and closing at dawn. The leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, while the stems are woody and can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. Darluca thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and support for its climbing habit. Its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening and traditional medicine."
