    "intro": "Diplazium lineolatum, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
