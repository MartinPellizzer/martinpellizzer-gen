    "intro": "Ditinnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant has a unique morphology, with thin, wiry stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Ditinnia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
