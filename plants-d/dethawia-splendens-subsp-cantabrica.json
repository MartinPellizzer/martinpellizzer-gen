    "intro": "Dethawia splendens subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian dethawia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain. It is a herbaceous perennial with lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces threats to its survival."
