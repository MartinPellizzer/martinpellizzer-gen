    "intro": "Dasycoleum philippinum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
