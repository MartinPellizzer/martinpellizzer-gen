    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. villosa, commonly known as hairy cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Hairy cocksfoot is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings as a livestock feed."
