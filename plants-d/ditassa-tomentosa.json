    "intro": "Ditassa tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are usually clustered in short inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds which are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it relies on specific host species for survival."
