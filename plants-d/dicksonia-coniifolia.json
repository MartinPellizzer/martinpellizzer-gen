    "intro": "Dicksonia coniifolia, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both sporangia and strobili, which are specialized structures for spore production. Its fronds are composed of a central vein with numerous leaflets, and the plant grows slowly, often taking decades to reach maturity. Dicksonia coniifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in temperate rainforests."
