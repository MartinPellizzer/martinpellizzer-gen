    "intro": "Dryopteris angustipalea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
