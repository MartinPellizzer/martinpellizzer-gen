    "intro": "Duretia \u00d7 pannosa, commonly known as the hybrid duretia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
