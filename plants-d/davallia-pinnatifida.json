    "intro": "Davallia pinnatifida, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central rosette of overlapping, wavy leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its roots absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
