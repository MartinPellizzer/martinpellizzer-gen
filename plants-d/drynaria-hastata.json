    "intro": "Drynaria hastata, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender, bamboo-like stems that are covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant produces fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. Drynaria hastata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the fern family."
