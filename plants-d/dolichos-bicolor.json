    "intro": "Dolichos bicolor, commonly known as the horsegram or two-color bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored leaves, which typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green or white underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, twisted pods containing edible seeds. Dolichos bicolor is valued for its high protein content and is used in various cuisines, particularly in South Asia. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
