    "intro": "Dalbergia salvanaturae, commonly known as the Sanctuary Rosewood, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystem."
