    "intro": "Dryopteris modesta, commonly known as the modest wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, specialized structures called sorus."
