    "intro": "Dalbergia vietnamensis, commonly known as Vietnamese rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
