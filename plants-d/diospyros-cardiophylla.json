    "intro": "Diospyros cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, dense wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
