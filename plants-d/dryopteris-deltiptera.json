    "intro": "Dryopteris deltiptera, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, almost triangular appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
