    "intro": "Dendropanax laurifolius, commonly known as the laurel-leafed arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which resemble those of the laurel family, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded environments. Its stems are often woody and can reach several meters in height. Dendropanax laurifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
