    "intro": "Dryopteris brevipinna, commonly known as the short-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, upright fronds with short, closely spaced pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. The short-pinnate wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
