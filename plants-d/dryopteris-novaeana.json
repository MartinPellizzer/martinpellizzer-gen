    "intro": "Dryopteris novaeana, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
