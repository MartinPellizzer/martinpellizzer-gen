    "intro": "Distictella pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered distictella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Distictella pauciflora is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
