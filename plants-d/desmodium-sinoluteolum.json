    "intro": "Desmodium sinoluteolum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Desmodium sinoluteolum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal practices."
