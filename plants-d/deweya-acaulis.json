    "intro": "Deweya acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has a compact, mat-like growth form with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Deweya acaulis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
