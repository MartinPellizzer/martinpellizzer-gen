    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cyrnea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of purple or pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is often poor in nutrients. Dactylorhiza cyrnea is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
