    "intro": "Dryopteris decussata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Europe, and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread readily. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, which adds to the plant's ornamental value."
