    "intro": "Draco glomerata, commonly known as the clustered dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered together, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically small and pointed, and it often grows in a compact, shrub-like form. Draco glomerata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
