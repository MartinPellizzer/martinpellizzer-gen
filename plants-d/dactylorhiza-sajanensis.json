    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
