    "intro": "Davallia pulcherrima, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies. Davallia pulcherrima is popular as a decorative plant due to its elegant foliage and low maintenance requirements."
