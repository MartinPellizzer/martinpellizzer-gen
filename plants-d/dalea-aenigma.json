    "intro": "Dalea aenigma, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, which are compound leaves made up of three leaflets. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Dalea aenigma is known for its rare and ephemeral blooms, which appear briefly during the spring and early summer."
