    "intro": "Dianella straminea, commonly known as the silver grass or silver lily, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Dianella straminea is also valued for its ability to form dense clumps, which can help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
