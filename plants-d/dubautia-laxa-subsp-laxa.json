    "intro": "Dubautia laxa subsp. laxa, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mesic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
