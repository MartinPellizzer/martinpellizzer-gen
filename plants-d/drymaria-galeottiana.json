It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Drymaria galeottiana is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species found in regions with Mediterranean or desert climates."
