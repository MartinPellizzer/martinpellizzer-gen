    "intro": "Dendrobium morio, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Dendrobium morio is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
