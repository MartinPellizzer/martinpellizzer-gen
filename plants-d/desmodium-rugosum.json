It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its growth habit and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its ecological significance in these environments."
