    "intro": "Danthonia tenuior, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to various regions of Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Danthonia tenuior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid or coastal landscapes."
