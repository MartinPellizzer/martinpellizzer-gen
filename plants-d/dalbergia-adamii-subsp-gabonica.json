    "intro": "Dalbergia adamii subsp. gabonica, commonly known as Gabon rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent, making it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
