    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp. leucothrix, commonly known as the white-threaded sandgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of hairs. This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in maritime dune systems."
