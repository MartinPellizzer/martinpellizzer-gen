    "intro": "Dicliptera unguiculata, commonly known as the African grass or wild millet, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardiness and ability to withstand drought, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage crop."
