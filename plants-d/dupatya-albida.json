    "intro": "Dupatya albida, commonly known as the white-flowered datura, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as moths. Dupatya albida contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires caution due to its potent effects."
