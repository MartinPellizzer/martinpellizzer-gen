    "intro": "Descurainia pimpinellifolia, commonly known as bitter cress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, pinnately divided leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
