    "intro": "Drymaria hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. Drymaria hirsuta is often found in disturbed or open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and gravelly slopes."
