    "intro": "Diplazium latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into numerous small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium latilobum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
