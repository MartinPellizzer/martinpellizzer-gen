    "intro": "Dendrobium chloropterum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces striking yellow-green flowers with a distinctive golden throat. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium chloropterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
