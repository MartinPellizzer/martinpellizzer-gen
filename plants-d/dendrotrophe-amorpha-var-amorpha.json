    "intro": "Dendrotrophe amorpha var. amorpha, commonly known as the silky hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elongated, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
