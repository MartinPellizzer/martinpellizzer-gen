    "intro": "Drosera hartmeyerorum, commonly known as the Hartmeyer's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy, nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete a viscous liquid to immobilize insects. Drosera hartmeyerorum is a low-growing plant that thrives in moist, shaded conditions, often found in swampy areas."
