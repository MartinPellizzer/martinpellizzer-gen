    "intro": "Dracocephalum tanguticum var. tanguticum, commonly known as Chinese chrysanthemum or Tangut chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
