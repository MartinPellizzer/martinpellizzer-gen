    "intro": "Dianthus scaber, commonly known as the rough pinks, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Dianthus scaber is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate."
