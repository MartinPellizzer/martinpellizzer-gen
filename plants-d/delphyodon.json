    "intro": "Delphyodon, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial or epiphytic growth habit, with slender stems and clustered leaves. The flowers are typically small and showy, often arranged in inflorescences, and come in a variety of colors. Delphyodon species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and the Pacific Islands. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
