    "intro": "Dryopteris subnigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that are leathery and deeply lobed, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris subnigra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
