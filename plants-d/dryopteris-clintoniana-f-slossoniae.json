    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana f. slossoniae, commonly known as the Slosson's wood fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
