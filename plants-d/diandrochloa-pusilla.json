    "intro": "Diandrochloa pusilla, commonly known as the small sand couch grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
