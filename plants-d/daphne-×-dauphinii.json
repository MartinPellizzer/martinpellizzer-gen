    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 dauphinii, commonly known as the pink daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
