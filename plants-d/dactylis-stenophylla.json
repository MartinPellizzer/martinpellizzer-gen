    "intro": "Dactylis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas due to its hardy nature. Dactylis stenophylla is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
