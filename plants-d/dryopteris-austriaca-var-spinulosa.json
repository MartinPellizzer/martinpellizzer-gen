    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca var. spinulosa, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern with spinous fronds, is a deciduous fern native to Central Europe. It features lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive spinulose texture along the margins. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
