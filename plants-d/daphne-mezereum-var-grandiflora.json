    "intro": "Daphne mezereum var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered mezereon, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that mature in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, though it can be toxic if ingested."
