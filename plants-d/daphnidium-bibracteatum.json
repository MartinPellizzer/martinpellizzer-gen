    "intro": "Daphnidium bibracteatum, commonly known as the two-bract daphnidium, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It produces two bracts beneath each flower, which are modified leaves that serve to protect the floral buds. Daphnidium bibracteatum thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
