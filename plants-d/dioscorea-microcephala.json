    "intro": "Dioscorea microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of D. microcephala are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
