It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid tropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
