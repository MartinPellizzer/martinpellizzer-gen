    "intro": "Deparia boryana subsp. austroindica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are used for their ornamental value in horticulture. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native ecosystems."
