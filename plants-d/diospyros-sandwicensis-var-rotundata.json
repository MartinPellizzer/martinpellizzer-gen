    "intro": "Diospyros sandwicensis var. rotundata, commonly known as the Koa 'Rotundata' or Hawaiian ebony, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, mesic forests at higher elevations. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, edible fruits that are often consumed by native birds and insects. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a significant species in Hawaiian botany. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
