    "intro": "Derris malaccensis var. millettioides, commonly known as the Malayan spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in forest understories rather than in open areas."
