    "intro": "Delphinium atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-lavender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Delphinium atropurpureum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
