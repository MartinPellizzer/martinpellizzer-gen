    "intro": "Dipcadi ursulae, commonly known as the Ursula's lily, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring and early summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Its bulbs are tuberous and store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dipcadi ursulae is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
