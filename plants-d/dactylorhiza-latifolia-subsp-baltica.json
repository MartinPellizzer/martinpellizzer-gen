    "intro": "Dactylorhiza latifolia subsp. baltica, commonly known as the Baltic broad-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with each pseudobulb producing a single leaf and a flowering stem. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with three sepals and three petals, and are arranged in a spike. The species is notable for its ecological significance in nutrient-poor environments and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
