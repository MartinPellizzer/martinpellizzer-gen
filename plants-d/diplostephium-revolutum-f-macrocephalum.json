    "intro": "Diplostephium revolutum f. macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant globe cactus, is a unique succulent belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its large, globular stems that can grow up to several meters in height, forming a tree-like structure. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its stems are covered in spines and have a thick, fleshy texture adapted for water storage. This variety is native to Mexico and is prized for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
