    "intro": "Damburneya guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan damburneya, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
