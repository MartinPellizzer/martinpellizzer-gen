    "intro": "Dryopteris sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichotang wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris sichotensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
