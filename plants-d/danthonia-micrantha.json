    "intro": "Danthonia micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects. Danthonia micrantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
