    "intro": "Dischidia kerrii, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a tropical vine belonging to the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Dischidia kerrii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
