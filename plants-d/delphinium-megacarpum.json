    "intro": "Delphinium megacarpum, commonly known as the giant blue delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy blue to violet flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough texture. Delphinium megacarpum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
