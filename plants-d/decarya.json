    "intro": "Decarya, commonly known as the \"spiny cactus\" or \"decarya cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and clusters of small, fleshy leaves. They produce yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Decarya species are well adapted to drought conditions and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements."
