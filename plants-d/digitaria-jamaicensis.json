    "intro": "Digitaria jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican digitaria, is a species of grass native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are erect with a tendency to spread by rhizomes. Digitaria jamaicensis is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
