    "intro": "Digitaria humifusa var. rubescens, commonly known as redstem dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a reddish color, giving it its common name. Its compact growth habit makes it a desirable ornamental grass for gardens and landscapes. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
