    "intro": "Drimia revoluta, commonly known as the rolling leaf arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often curled or rolled at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Drimia revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
