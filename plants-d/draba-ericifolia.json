    "intro": "Draba ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Draba ericifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is an indicator species for alpine habitats."
