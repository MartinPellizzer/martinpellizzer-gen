    "intro": "Dryoathyrium henryi, commonly known as the Henry's dryoathyrium, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
