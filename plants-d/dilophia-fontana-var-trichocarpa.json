    "intro": "Dilophia fontana var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, aiding in buoyancy and light reflection. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, which open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
