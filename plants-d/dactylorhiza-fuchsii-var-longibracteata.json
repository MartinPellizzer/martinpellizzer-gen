    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous pale purple to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower spikes, giving it its specific epithet."
