    "intro": "Dichapetalum prancei, commonly known as the Prance's dichapetalum, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features showy, large, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting specific pollinators. It is often found growing in rocky or disturbed habitats, reflecting its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichapetalum prancei is considered a vulnerable species."
