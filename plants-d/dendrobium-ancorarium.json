It features a sympodial growth habit with erect, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences of clustered, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapting to its rocky and humid habitats. Dendrobium ancorarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
