    "intro": "Dilomilis filicina, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs, which aid in water retention. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
