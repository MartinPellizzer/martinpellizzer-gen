    "intro": "Dianthus armeria subsp. armeriastrum, commonly known as the rock campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
