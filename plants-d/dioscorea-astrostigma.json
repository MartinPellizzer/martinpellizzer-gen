    "intro": "Dioscorea astrostigma, commonly known as the yellow arrowhead, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
