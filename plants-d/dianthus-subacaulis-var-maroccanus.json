    "intro": "Dianthus subacaulis var. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan carnation, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Morocco. It features delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, with petals that are often edged in a contrasting color. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its low-growing habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh, arid conditions."
