    "intro": "Dryopteris triangularis, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
