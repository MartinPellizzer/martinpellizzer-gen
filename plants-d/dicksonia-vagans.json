    "intro": "Dicksonia vagans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and appearance. Dicksonia vagans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil."
