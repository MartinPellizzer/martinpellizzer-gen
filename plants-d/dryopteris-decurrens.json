    "intro": "Dryopteris decurrens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through underground runners."
