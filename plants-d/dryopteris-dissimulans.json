    "intro": "Dryopteris dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
