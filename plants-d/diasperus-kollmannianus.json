    "intro": "Diasperus kollmannianus, commonly known as the Kollmann's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control."
