    "intro": "Digitalis isabelliana, commonly known as the Isabelline foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence of spurred flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies. Digitalis isabelliana contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in medicinal use."
