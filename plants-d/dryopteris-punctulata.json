    "intro": "Dryopteris punctulata, commonly known as the dotterel fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded black spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
