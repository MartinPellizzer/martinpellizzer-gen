    "intro": "Derris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan spurge or Hainan derris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China's Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Derris hainanensis is also notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used in pest control due to its insecticidal properties."
