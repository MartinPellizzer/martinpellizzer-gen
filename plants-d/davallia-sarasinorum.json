    "intro": "Davallia sarasinorum, commonly known as the bamboo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that resemble bamboo in appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
