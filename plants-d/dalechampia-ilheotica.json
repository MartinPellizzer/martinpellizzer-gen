    "intro": "Dalechampia ilheotica, commonly known as the Ilheus dalechampia, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange bracts. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
