    "intro": "Daphne kamtschatica var. jezoensis, commonly known as the Jezoensis Daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and winter interest."
