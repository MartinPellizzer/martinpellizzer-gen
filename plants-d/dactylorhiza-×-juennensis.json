    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 juennensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid between Dactylorhiza lapponica and Dactylorhiza macrantha, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments. It produces tall, erect stems with clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Due to its hybrid origin, it is often found in areas where the parent species overlap geographically."
