    "intro": "Dryopteris expansa subsp. assimilis, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
