    "intro": "Draba reptans var. micrantha, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, and its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across rocky or alpine habitats. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. The species is also characterized by its tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in clusters of 2 to 5."
