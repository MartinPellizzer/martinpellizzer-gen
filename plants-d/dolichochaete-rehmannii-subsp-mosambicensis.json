    "intro": "Dolichochaete rehmannii subsp. mosambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
