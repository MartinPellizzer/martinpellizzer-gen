    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. aurata, commonly known as golden tuft grass, is a variant of the tufted hairgrass species. It is a perennial grass native to North America, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and golden-yellow inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, while the flowering stems are upright and bear spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
