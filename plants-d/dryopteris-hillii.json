    "intro": "Dryopteris hillii, commonly known as the Hill's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. The plant features a stout, wiry rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, meaning they have a single, broad blade without a true pinna. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, upright foliage."
