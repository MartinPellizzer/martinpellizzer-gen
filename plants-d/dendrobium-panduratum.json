    "intro": "Dendrobium panduratum, commonly known as the golden bower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium panduratum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
