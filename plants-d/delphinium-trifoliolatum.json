    "intro": "Delphinium trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, spurred blue to purple flowers. The leaves are compound, typically consisting of three leaflets, which are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids."
