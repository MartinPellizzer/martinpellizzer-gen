    "intro": "Dendrobium brisbanense, commonly known as the Brisbane orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Queensland, Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and produce clusters of flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. Its flowers are typically white or pale green with a yellow lip, and they bloom during the cooler months. Dendrobium brisbanense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
