    "intro": "Dryopteris hassleri, commonly known as the Texas holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
