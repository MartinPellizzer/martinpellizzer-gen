    "intro": "Dendrocnide basirotunda, commonly known as the broad-leaf stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and stinging nettle species, and is characterized by its toxic, hair-like structures called trichomes. The leaves are typically large, broad, and have a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds. Due to its potent urticating hairs, it is often avoided by humans and animals alike."
