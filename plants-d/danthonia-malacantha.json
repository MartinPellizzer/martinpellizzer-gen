    "intro": "Danthonia malacantha, commonly known as the silky danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Danthonia malacantha is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in dry, disturbed environments."
