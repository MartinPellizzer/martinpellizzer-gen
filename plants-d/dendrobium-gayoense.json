    "intro": "Dendrobium gayoense, commonly known as the Gayo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium gayoense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
