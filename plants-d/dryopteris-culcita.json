    "intro": "Dryopteris culcita, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
