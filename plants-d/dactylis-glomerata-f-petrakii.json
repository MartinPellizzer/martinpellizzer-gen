    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. petrakii, commonly known as the Petrak\u2019s hairy vetch, is a horticultural form of the common hairy vetch. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and the presence of hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and is adapted to well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a ground cover plant."
