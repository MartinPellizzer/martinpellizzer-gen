    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 madalenae, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arching and have a serrated edge. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to its parent species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
