    "intro": "Duretia taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's duretia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
