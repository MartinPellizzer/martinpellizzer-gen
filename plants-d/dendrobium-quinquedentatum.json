    "intro": "Dendrobium quinquedentatum, commonly known as the five-toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with dense clusters of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, elongated labellum. Dendrobium quinquedentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
