    "intro": "Dacryodes olivifera, commonly known as the African olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It typically grows up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, rounded canopy and smooth, dark brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that turn red when mature. It is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
