    "intro": "Digitaria microstachya, commonly known as little fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it common in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Digitaria microstachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
