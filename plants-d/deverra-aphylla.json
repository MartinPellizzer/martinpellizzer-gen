    "intro": "Deverra aphylla, commonly known as the leafless devil's backbone, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having modified structures called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. Its stems are often ribbed and can vary in color from green to red, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Deverra aphylla is well adapted to low rainfall and high sunlight, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
