    "intro": "Dryopteris mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rocks. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
