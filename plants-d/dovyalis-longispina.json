It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, sour fruits similar to grapes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of traditional food."
