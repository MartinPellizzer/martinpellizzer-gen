It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a host plant for certain insect species."
