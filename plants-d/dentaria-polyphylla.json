    "intro": "Dentaria polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a rough, toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Its unique foliage and early blooming period make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
