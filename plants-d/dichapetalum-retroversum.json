    "intro": "Dichapetalum retroversum, commonly known as the upside-down lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that face downward, a feature that distinguishes it from most other lilies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a waxy coating, while its flowers are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. Dichapetalum retroversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
