    "intro": "Dendrobium asahanense, commonly known as the Asahan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its often-dry habitat. Dendrobium asahanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for horticultural purposes."
