    "intro": "Deppeopsis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are clustered in umbels, often with a distinctive yellow or orange hue. Deppeopsis species are known for their milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Asclepiadaceae family. These plants are adapted to harsh environments and play a role in supporting local pollinators."
