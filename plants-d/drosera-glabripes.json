    "intro": "Drosera glabripes, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often in regions with high light exposure. Its leaves are usually short and broad, with a dense covering of digestive secretions. Drosera glabripes is a perennial species that thrives in nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
