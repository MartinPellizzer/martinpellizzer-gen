    "intro": "Distichorchis sandsii, commonly known as the sandstone orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
