    "intro": "Dryopteris gordonii, commonly known as Gordon's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
