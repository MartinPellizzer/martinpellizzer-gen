    "intro": "Dendrobium rachmatii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in yellow or green hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Dendrobium rachmatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
