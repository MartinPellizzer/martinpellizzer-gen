    "intro": "Dryopteris malangae, commonly known as the Malang fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in the spread of the plant, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
