    "intro": "Dryopteris levyi, commonly known as the Lev's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Dryopteris levyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
