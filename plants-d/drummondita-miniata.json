    "intro": "Drummondita miniata, commonly known as the dwarf drummondia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Drummondita miniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
