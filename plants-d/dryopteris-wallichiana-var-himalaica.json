    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appearance in horticulture."
