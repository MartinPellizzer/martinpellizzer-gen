    "intro": "Dryopteris platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to round fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
