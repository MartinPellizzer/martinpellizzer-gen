It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its delicate, lance-shaped leaves.
