    "intro": "Diplazium arboreum var. unilobum, commonly known as the single-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into a single large lobe. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, which can help stabilize sediment and improve water quality. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative element in aquatic gardens."
