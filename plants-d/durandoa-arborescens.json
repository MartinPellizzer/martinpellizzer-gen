    "intro": "Durandoa arborescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed."
