    "intro": "Dryopteris rusbyi var. major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped outline. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
