It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring erect stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are lanceolate in shape. Delphinium breviscaposum is characterized by its short, broad flower buds, which give it its common name."
