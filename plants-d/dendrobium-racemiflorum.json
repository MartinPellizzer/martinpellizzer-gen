    "intro": "Dendrobium racemiflorum, commonly known as the racemiflorum orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
