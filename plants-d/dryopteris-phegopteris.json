    "intro": "Dryopteris phegopteris, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, linear segments called pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its habitat."
