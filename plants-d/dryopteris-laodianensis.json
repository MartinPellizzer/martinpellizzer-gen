    "intro": "Dryopteris laodianensis, commonly known as the Lao Dan fern, is a species of polypod fern native to China. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
