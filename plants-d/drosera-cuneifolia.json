    "intro": "Drosera cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it thrives in moist, acidic environments. Drosera cuneifolia is often found in heathlands and wetlands, where it can absorb nutrients from captured prey. Its unique adaptation allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with insect prey."
