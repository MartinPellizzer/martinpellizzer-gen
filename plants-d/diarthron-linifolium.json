    "intro": "Diarthron linifolium, commonly known as the silky grass or silky fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping rhizomes that give rise to delicate, arching stems covered in soft, silky hairs. The leaves are compound, with finely divided, linear lobes that contribute to its feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that produce lightweight seeds dispersed by wind."
