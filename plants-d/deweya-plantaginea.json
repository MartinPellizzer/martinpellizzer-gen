    "intro": "Deweya plantaginea, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
