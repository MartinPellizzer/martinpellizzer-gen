    "intro": "Dichondra sericea var. microcalyx, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
