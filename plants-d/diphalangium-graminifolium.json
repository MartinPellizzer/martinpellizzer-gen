    "intro": "Diphalangium graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leafed diphalangium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of true grasses. The plant produces small, umbellate inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
