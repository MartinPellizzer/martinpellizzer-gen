It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking blue to purple flower spikes. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, while the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.
