    "intro": "Drosera menziesii subsp. basifolia, commonly known as the coastal sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide essential nutrients. This subspecies typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and beaches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, and the plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is considered a rare and specialized species."
