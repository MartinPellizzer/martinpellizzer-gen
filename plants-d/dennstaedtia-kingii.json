    "intro": "Dennstaedtia kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a species native to the wet tropical forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant, often found on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. Its fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
