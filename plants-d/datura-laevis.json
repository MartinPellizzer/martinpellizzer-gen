    "intro": "Datura laevis, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can be white, yellow, or purple, depending on the variety. The plant produces smooth, green, egg-shaped leaves and has a milky sap that is toxic. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its strong, aromatic fragrance. Datura laevis is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
