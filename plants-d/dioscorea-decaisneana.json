    "intro": "Dioscorea decaisneana, commonly known as the African yam vine, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing herbaceous perennial that produces tubers similar to those of yams, which are used as food in some regions. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its nutritional value, it has been traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities in parts of Africa."
