    "intro": "Draba tomentosa proles laevipes, commonly known as the smooth-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Draba tomentosa proles laevipes plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
