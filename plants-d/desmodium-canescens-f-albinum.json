    "intro": "Desmodium canescens f. albinum, commonly known as the white-leaf desmodium, is a variant of the perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green form of the species. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
