    "intro": "Diospyros perglauca, commonly known as the pale persimmon, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other notable species like the ebony tree. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by edible, orange-red fruits that are similar in appearance to persimmons. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use compared to other species in its family."
