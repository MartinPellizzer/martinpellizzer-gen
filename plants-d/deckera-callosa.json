    "intro": "Deckera callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface, which gives the plant its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
