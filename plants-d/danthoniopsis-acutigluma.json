It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with a sharp, pointed tip. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems and a subject of study in grassland ecology."
