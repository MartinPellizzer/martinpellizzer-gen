It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers along the stem, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Disa procera thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts."
