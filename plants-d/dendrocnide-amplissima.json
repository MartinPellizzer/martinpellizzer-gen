    "intro": "Dendrocnide amplissima, commonly known as the giant stinging tree, is a member of the Dendrocnidieae subfamily within the family Urticaceae. It is native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Australia, particularly in the Cape York Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest species in its genus. Its most notable feature is the presence of potent urticating hairs, which can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. These hairs are hollow and contain a mixture of alkaloids and other irritants, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
