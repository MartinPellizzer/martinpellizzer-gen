    "intro": "Danthoniopsis purpurea, commonly known as the purple muirgrass, is a perennial grass native to South Africa. It features slender, erect stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale purple to pink flowers in late summer to autumn. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Danthoniopsis purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments."
