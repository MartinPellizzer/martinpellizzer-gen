    "intro": "Dieffenbachia picta var. weirii, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical houseplant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green veins and cream or white markings. The plant has large, broad leaves that are often heart-shaped or lanceolate in form. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic sap, it should be kept away from pets and children."
