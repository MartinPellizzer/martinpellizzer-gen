    "intro": "Dalea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Dalea procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
