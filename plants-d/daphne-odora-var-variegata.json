    "intro": "Daphne odora var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated winter daphne, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in containers to prevent root damage."
