It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, hooded flowers. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots contain cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and medicinally significant.
