    "intro": "Dodecatheon splendidum, commonly known as the showy glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding a vibrant touch to early-season landscapes."
