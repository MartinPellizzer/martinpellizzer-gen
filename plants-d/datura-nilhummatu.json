    "intro": "Datura nilhummatu, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Nilum people, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often appearing in clusters at the top of its tall, erect stems. The plant produces smooth, green, egg-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it is often associated with spiritual and medicinal significance in local cultures. The seeds are enclosed in a spiny capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
