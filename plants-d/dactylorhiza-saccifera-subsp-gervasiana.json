    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp. gervasiana, commonly known as the Gervasa's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as peatlands and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single spike of pale to deep purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like structures at the base of the stem. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
