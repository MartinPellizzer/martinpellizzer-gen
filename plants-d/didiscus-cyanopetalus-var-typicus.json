    "intro": "Didiscus cyanopetalus var. typicus, commonly known as the blue-petaled didiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue petals, which are often tinged with purple, and its distinctive, flattened, disc-like flower structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a short growing season. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, dark green fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
