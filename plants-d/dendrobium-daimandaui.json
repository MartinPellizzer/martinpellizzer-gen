    "intro": "Dendrobium daimandaui, commonly known as the Daimandaui orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often in clusters. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Dendrobium daimandaui is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
