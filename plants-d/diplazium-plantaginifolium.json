    "intro": "Diplazium plantaginifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
