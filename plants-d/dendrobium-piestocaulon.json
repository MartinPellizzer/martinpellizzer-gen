    "intro": "Dendrobium piestocaulon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Dendrobium piestocaulon thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
