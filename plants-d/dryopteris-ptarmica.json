    "intro": "Dryopteris ptarmica, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris ptarmica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
