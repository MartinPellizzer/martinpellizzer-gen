    "intro": "Dryopteris eberhardtii var. glabrata, commonly known as the Eberhardt's shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time."
