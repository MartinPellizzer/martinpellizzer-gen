    "intro": "Diplazium angustisquamatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with narrow, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat."
