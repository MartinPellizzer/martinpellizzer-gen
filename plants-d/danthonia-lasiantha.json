    "intro": "Danthonia lasiantha, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia lasiantha is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
