    "intro": "Dendrobium sematoglossum, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive, hairy lip. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium sematoglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
