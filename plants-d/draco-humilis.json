    "intro": "Draco humilis, commonly known as the dwarf dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, woody stem with fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
