    "intro": "Desmodium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Desmodium macrophyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
