    "intro": "Dryopteris flavovirens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
