    "intro": "Dendrobium heokhuii, commonly known as the Heokhui orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, fragrant scent. Dendrobium heokhuii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
