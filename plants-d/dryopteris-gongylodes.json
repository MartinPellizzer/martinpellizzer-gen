    "intro": "Dryopteris gongylodes, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, compact crown of dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance that gives the plant its ornamental value. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
