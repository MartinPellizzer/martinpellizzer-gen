    "intro": "Dalea microphylla var. brevis, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
