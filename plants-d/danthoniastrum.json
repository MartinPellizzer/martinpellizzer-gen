It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, needle-shaped leaves. The plants typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Danthoniastrum species are known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and their resilience to grazing. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
