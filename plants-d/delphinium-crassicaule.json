    "intro": "Delphinium crassicaule, commonly known as the broadleaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Delphinium crassicaule is valued in gardens for its striking floral display but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
