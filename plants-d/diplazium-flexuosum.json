    "intro": "Diplazium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread along the forest floor. Diplazium flexuosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
