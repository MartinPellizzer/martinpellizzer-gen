    "intro": "Dactilis, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, often appearing in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Dactilis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
