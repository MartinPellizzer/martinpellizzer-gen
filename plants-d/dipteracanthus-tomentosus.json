    "intro": "Dipteracanthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight pinkish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
