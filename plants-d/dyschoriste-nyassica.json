It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
