It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow when mature. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are often used in traditional medicine. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
