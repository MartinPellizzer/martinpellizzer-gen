    "intro": "Daphniphyllum majus var. deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous winterberry holly, is a shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that turn bright red in the fall before shedding in winter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. Its seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens with varying light conditions."
