    "intro": "Dendrobium gunnarii, commonly known as the Gunns' orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its erect, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium gunnarii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
