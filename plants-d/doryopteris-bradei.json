    "intro": "Doryopteris bradei, commonly known as the Brade's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sori, which are clusters of sporangia, on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Central and South America. Doryopteris bradei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light."
