It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces pale pink to white blooms during the spring season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
