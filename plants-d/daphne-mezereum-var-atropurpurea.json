    "intro": "Daphne mezereum var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered mezereum, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that ripen to a red color in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution during handling and cultivation."
