    "intro": "Delphinium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often glandular, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in alpine or rocky environments. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
