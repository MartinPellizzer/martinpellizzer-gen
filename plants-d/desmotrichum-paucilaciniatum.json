    "intro": "Desmotrichum paucilaciniatum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dryland gardens."
