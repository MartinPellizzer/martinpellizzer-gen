    "intro": "Dalbergia cloiselii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in small clusters. It produces small, round legumes that contain the seeds, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
