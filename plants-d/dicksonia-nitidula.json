    "intro": "Dicksonia nitidula, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of a waxy coating on its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dicksonia nitidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
