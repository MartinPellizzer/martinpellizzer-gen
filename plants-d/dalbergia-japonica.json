    "intro": "Dalbergia japonica, commonly known as Japanese rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, though it is not as prized as other rosewood species. Dalbergia japonica prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
