    "intro": "Dryopteris hatusimae, commonly known as the Hatusima wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
