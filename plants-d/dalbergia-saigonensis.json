    "intro": "Dalbergia saigonensis, commonly known as Vietnamese rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces hard, dark-colored timber that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its natural habitat."
