    "intro": "Datura versicolor, commonly known as the multiflora nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. Datura versicolor thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some regions."
