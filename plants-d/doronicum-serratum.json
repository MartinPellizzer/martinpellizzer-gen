    "intro": "Doronicum serratum, commonly known as the serrated leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive dark center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
