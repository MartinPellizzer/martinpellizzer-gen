    "intro": "Dryopteris scabra, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, arching fronds with a rough, serrated texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
