It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
