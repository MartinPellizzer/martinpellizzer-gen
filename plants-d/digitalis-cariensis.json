    "intro": "Digitalis cariensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear hooded flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant produces tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Digitalis cariensis contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in medicine."
