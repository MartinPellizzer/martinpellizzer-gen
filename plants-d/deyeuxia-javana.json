    "intro": "Deyeuxia javana, commonly known as the Java sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice fields, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Deyeuxia javana is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
