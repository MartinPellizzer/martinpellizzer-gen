    "intro": "Daemonorops ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy palm, is a species of cycad that is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
