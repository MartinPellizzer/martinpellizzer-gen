    "intro": "Dichopogon tyleri, commonly known as the mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichopogon tyleri is considered a rare and endangered species."
