    "intro": "Dodonaea salicifolia, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Dodonaea salicifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade."
