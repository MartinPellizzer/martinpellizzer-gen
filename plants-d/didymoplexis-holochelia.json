    "intro": "Didymoplexis holochelia, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spider-like inflorescence. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur that attracts pollinators. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
