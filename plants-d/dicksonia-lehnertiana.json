    "intro": "Dicksonia lehnertiana, commonly known as the Lehnert's tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen tree fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system composed of a central rhizome with adventitious roots that anchor it to the substrate. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a long, narrow petiole and a broad, feather-like blade. Dicksonia lehnertiana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
