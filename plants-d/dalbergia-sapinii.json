    "intro": "Dalbergia sapinii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, woodland areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
