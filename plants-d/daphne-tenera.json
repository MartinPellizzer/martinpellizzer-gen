    "intro": "Daphne tenera, commonly known as the Canary Island daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its most striking characteristic is its showy clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Daphne tenera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
