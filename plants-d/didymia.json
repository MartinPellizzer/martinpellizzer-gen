    "intro": "Didymia, commonly known as the \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of about 10 species, primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often characterized by their bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Didymia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or streambanks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
