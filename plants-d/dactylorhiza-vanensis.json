    "intro": "Dactylorhiza vanensis, commonly known as the Van's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and mountain meadows. The plant features a rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears several oval, leathery leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Dactylorhiza vanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
