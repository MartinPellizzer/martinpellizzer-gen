    "intro": "Dryopteris triangula, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that form a rosette shape, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, leathery rhizome that anchors it to surfaces such as trees or rocks, and its fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is frequently used in horticulture and landscape design."
