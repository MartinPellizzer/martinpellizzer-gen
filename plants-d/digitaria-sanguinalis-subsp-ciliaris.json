    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis subsp. ciliaris, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Hairy fingergrass is adapted to warm climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
