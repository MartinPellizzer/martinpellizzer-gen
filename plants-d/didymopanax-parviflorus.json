    "intro": "Didymopanax parviflorus, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bi- or tri-pinnate, and its distinctive yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain multiple seeds, each encased in a hard, brown shell. These seeds are the edible Brazil nuts, which are commercially valuable and ecologically important. The plant plays a crucial role in the rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
