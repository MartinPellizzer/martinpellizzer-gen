    "intro": "Devendraea spinosa, commonly known as the spiny devendraea, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant features woody stems with spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
