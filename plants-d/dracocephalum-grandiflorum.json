    "intro": "Dracocephalum grandiflorum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Dracocephalum grandiflorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
