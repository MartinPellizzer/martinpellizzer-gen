    "intro": "Dacrydium intermedium, commonly known as the New Zealand rimu, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is wind-pollinated, leading to the development of cone-like structures. Dacrydium intermedium is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching over 500 years of age."
