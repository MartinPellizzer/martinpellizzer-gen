    "intro": "Diplotropis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Diplotropis triloba plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
