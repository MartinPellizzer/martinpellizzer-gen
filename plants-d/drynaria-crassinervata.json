    "intro": "Drynaria crassinervata, commonly known as the broad-veined tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with broad, parallel veins that give it its common name. Drynaria crassinervata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
