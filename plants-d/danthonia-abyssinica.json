    "intro": "Danthonia abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
