    "intro": "Dactylis spicata, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in a cylindrical spike that is often mistaken for a cluster of small fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Dactylis spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
