    "intro": "Delphinium robertianum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
