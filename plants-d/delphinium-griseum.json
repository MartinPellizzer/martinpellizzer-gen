    "intro": "Delphinium griseum, commonly known as the pale larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Delphinium griseum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to both humans and animals due to its alkaloid content."
