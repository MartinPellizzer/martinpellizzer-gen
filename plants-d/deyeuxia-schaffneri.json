It is characterized by its triangular, often ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.
