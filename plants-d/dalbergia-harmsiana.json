    "intro": "Dalbergia harmsiana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
