It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a thick, leathery texture with a distinctive, serrated margin on its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes and cliffs. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds."
