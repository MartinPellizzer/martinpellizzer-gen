It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is often found in the northern United States and southern Canada, where it plays a role in early-season pollination."
