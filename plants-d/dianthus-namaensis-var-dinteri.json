    "intro": "Dianthus namaensis var. dinteri, commonly known as the Namib Desert campion, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
