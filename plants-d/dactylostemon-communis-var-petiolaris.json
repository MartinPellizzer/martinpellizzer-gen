    "intro": "Dactylostemon communis var. petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the petioles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy berries. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
