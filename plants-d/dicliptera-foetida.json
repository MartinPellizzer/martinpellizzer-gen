    "intro": "Dicliptera foetida, commonly known as the stinking panic grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in disturbed areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
