    "intro": "Dianthus gabrielianae, commonly known as the Gabrielian carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers with a distinctive, frilly appearance. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
