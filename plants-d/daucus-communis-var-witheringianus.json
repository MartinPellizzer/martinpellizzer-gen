    "intro": "Daucus communis var. witheringianus, commonly known as the Withering's carrot, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a taproot that is typically smaller and less fleshy compared to other carrots. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
