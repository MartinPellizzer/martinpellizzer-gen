It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, compact structure. Dryopteris tomentella is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
