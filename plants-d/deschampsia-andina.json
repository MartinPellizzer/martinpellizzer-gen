    "intro": "Deschampsia andina, commonly known as Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and delicate, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. Deschampsia andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
