    "intro": "Dryopteris mimetica, commonly known as the mimic wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in the identification of fern species."
