    "intro": "Dryandra ferruginea subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf dryandra, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spherical inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than branches. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. This subspecies is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathland and woodland environments."
