    "intro": "Dracula astuta, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red or purple flowers that resemble blood, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Dracula astuta is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
