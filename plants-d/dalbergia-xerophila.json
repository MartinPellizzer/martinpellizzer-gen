    "intro": "Dalbergia xerophila, commonly known as the Namib Desert bean, is a leguminous plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is a small shrub adapted to extreme drought conditions, featuring thick, waxy leaves to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flattened, dark seeds. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing limited forage for local wildlife. Due to its ecological significance and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
