    "intro": "Digitaria hydrophila, commonly known as water grass or swamp grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist soils. Digitaria hydrophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
