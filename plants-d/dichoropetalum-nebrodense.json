    "intro": "Dichoropetalum nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodian dichoropetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of Sicily. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-lipped petals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained habitats and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native environment. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
