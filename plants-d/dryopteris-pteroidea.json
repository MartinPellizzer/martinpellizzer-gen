    "intro": "Dryopteris pteroidea, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
