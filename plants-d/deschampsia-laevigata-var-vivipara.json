    "intro": "Deschampsia laevigata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist to wet habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. One distinguishing feature is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow independently, aiding in vegetative propagation. This variety is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
