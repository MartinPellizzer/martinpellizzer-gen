    "intro": "Dryopteris wattsii, commonly known as the Watts' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
