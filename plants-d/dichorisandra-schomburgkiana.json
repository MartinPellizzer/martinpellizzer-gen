It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment.

Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in warm climates."
