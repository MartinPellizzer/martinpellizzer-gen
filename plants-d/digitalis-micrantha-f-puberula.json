    "intro": "Digitalis micrantha f. puberula, commonly known as the downy foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences of tubular, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bumblebees, which can access the nectar through a specialized opening. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in medicine."
