    "intro": "Dryopteris anateinophlebia, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
