    "intro": "Drynaria angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
