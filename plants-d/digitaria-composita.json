    "intro": "Digitaria composita, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and sometimes invasive species. Digitaria composita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
