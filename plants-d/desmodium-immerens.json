    "intro": "Desmodium immerens, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Desmodium immerens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
