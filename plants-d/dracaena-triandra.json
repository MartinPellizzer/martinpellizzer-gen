    "intro": "Dracaena triandra, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with red margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena triandra is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
