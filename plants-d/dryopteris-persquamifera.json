    "intro": "Dryopteris persquamifera, commonly known as the broad-ovate wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, ovate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
