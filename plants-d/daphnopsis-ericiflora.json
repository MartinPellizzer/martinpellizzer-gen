    "intro": "Daphnopsis ericiflora, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and aromatic, with a distinctive scent when crushed. Daphnopsis ericiflora plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
