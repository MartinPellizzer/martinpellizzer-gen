    "intro": "Decaneuropsis garrettiana, commonly known as the Garrett's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
