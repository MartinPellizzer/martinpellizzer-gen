    "intro": "Drosera paleacea subsp. leioblastus, commonly known as the pale pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are covered in hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey."
