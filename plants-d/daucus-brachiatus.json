    "intro": "Daucus brachiatus, commonly known as the branched carrot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its root system is less developed compared to the edible carrots, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
