    "intro": "Davallia anderssonii, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically bright green, with a slight golden hue on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value."
