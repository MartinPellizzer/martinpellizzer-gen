It features silvery-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
