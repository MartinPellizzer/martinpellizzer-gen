    "intro": "Daphne alba subsp. anhuiensis, commonly known as the Anhui white spurge, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
