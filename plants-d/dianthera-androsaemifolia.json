    "intro": "Dianthera androsaemifolia, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Dianthera androsaemifolia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
