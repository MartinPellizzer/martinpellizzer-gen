    "intro": "Dendrobium babiense, commonly known as the Babiense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium babiense thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
