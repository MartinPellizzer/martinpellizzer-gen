    "intro": "Diospyros duckei, commonly known as the Malayan persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark red or orange color. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically consumed when fully ripe, and the tree is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
