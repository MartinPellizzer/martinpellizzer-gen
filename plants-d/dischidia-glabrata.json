    "intro": "Dischidia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth dischidia, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, followed by round, berry-like fruits. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ability to climb or trail from hanging baskets. Dischidia glabrata is also noted for its air-purifying properties and ease of care."
