    "intro": "Danthonia airoides var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing waterlogged soils."
