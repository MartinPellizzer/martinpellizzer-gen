    "intro": "Dolichochaete bicrinita, commonly known as the two-horned hair grass, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its name refers to the two distinct, branching structures at the base of its flowers, which are prominent under a microscope. Dolichochaete bicrinita is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
