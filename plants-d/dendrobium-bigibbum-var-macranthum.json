    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum var. macranthum, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, with clusters of large, showy flowers that are typically red or orange with yellow throats. Its flowers are borne on the stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular ornamental plant. The variety is prized for its vibrant color and unique floral structure, which sets it apart from other dendrobium species."
