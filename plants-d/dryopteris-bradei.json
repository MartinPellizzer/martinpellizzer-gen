    "intro": "Dryopteris bradei, commonly known as the Brade's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris bradei plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
