It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its distinctive, feathery fronds. Dendrorkis ramulosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the understory vegetation."
