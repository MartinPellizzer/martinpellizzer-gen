    "intro": "Doritis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of many orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
