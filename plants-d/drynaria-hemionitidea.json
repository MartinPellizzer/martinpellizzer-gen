    "intro": "Drynaria hemionitidea, commonly known as the Chinese cliff fern, is a fern species native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky slopes or in shaded forest areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with dense, dark green fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
