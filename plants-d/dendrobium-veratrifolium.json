    "intro": "Dendrobium veratrifolium, commonly known as the false orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple stems and leaves. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in hardwood forests."
