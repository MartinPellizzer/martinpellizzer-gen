    "intro": "Dryopteris heineri, commonly known as the Heiner's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in its habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
