    "intro": "Dryopteris foxii, commonly known as the Fox's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming compact clumps over time. The fronds are deciduous, turning brown and withering in the winter before regrowing in the spring."
