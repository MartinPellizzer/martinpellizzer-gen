    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in wet, boggy habitats. The plant has fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in moist environments."
