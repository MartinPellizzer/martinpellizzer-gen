    "intro": "Dichanthelium albomaculatum, commonly known as the white-spotted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale-colored flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Dichanthelium albomaculatum is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
