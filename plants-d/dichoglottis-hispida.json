    "intro": "Dichoglottis hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes that are used as a starch source, similar to taro. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces berries that are edible. Dichoglottis hispida is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental qualities in gardens."
