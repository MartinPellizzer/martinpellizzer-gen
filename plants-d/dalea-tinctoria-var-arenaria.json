    "intro": "Dalea tinctoria var. arenaria, commonly known as the sandblush or desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss."
