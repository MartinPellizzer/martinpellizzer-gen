    "intro": "Dendrobium parvulum subsp. parvulum, commonly known as the small dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, fleshy stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, warm climates with bright, indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural cultivation."
