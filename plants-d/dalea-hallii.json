    "intro": "Dalea hallii, commonly known as Hall's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has compound leaves with slender, thread-like leaflets. Dalea hallii is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and contribute to its role in local ecosystems."
