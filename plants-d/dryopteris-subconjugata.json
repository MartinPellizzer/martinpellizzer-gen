    "intro": "Dryopteris subconjugata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinctive morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
