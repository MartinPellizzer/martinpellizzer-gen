    "intro": "Diospyros bumelioides, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and often have a reddish or purple tinge when young. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, dark purple to black berries. Its fruit is an aggregate of small drupes, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
