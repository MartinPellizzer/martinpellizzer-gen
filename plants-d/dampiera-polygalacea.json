    "intro": "Dampiera polygalacea, commonly known as the silver leaf daisy, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Dampiera polygalacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
