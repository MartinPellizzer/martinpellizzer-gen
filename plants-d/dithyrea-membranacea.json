    "intro": "Dithyrea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous dithyrea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among botanists."
