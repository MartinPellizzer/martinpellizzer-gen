    "intro": "Dendrobium heterocarpum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting dark center. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
