    "intro": "Dryopteris neorosthornii, commonly known as the Neorosthornii wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright growth habit. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in rocky or forested soils. The plant's spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
