    "intro": "Davallia padioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that form a dense, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
