    "intro": "Dieffenbachia irrorata, commonly known as the \"White Star Dieffenbachia,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves with striking white veins and a central white stripe. The plant produces tall, upright inflorescences with white bracts that resemble flowers, though it is not actually flowering. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia irrorata is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
