    "intro": "Dracaena atropurpurea var. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slight purplish tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though these are not typically prominent in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
