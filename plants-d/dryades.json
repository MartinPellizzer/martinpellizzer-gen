    "intro": "Dryades, commonly known as dryads, are mythological forest nymphs associated with trees, but the term can also refer to certain types of plants. In botanical terms, the name is sometimes used to describe species of plants that have a strong connection to woodland environments. These plants often thrive in shaded, moist conditions typical of forest floors. They may include various ferns, mosses, and flowering plants adapted to low light. Their presence is indicative of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
