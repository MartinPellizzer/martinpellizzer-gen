    "intro": "Deparia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, often fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture, making it well adapted to humid, temperate climates."
