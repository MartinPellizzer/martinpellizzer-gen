    "intro": "Dryopteris matutumensis, commonly known as the morning fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and often have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's name reflects its tendency to emerge early in the spring, signaling the arrival of warmer weather."
