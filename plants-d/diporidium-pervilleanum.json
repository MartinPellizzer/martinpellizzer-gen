    "intro": "Diporidium pervilleanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
