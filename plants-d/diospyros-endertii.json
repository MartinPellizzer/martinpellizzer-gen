    "intro": "Diospyros endertii, commonly known as the Ender's persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in the understory of dense vegetation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
