    "intro": "Diplopappus delphinifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, two-parted fruit that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
