    "intro": "Dendrocalamus collettianus, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can reach heights of over 30 meters. The plant has a strong, fibrous culm with a smooth, often green or yellowish-brown surface. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a prominent midrib and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Dendrocalamus collettianus is valued for its durable and lightweight bamboo, which is used in construction, crafts, and as a source of raw material for various industrial applications."
