    "intro": "Delphinium stocksianum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. This variety is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
