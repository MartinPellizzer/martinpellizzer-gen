    "intro": "Dinosperma, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Dinosperma is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
