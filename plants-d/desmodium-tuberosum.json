    "intro": "Desmodium tuberosum, commonly known as hairy sida, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium tuberosum is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
