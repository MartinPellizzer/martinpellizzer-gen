    "intro": "Diplorhynchus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Diplorhynchus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
