    "intro": "Dalea flavorosea, commonly known as the sweetroot or flavorosea milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea flavorosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
