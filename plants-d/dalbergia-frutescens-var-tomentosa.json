It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and small, leathery leaves. The tree produces hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its aromatic properties and durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
