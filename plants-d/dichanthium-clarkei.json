It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to warm, arid climates. Dichanthium clarkei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
