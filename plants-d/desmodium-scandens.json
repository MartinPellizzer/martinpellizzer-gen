    "intro": "Desmodium scandens, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its twining stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. It is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Desmodium scandens is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
