    "intro": "Dryopteris paucijugum, commonly known as the few-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
