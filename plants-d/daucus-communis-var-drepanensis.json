    "intro": "Daucus communis var. drepanensis, commonly known as the slender carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in umbels. Its roots are thin and less developed compared to cultivated carrots, but they contain similar compounds. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its genetic diversity in botanical studies."
