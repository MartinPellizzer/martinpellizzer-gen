    "intro": "Diplothemium henryanum, commonly known as the Henry's diplothemium, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
