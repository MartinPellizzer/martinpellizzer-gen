    "intro": "Dryas ajanensis var. viridis, commonly known as the green-leaved mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
