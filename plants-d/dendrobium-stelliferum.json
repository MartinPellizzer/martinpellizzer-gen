    "intro": "Dendrobium stelliferum, commonly known as the star-laden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, branching structure with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium stelliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, star-shaped blooms."
