    "intro": "Drynaria latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
