    "intro": "Dipteracanthus geminiflorus var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy dipteracanthus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Dipteracanthus genus. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist forest understories. Its botanical features include elongated, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
