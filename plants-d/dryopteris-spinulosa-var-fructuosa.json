    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. fructuosa, commonly known as the fruiting wood fern, is a variant of the spinulose wood fern. It is a deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features frond-like leaves that are pinnately divided with a distinctive, serrated edge. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This variety is notable for its unique fruiting structures, which are more developed than in the typical form of the species."
