    "intro": "Dioscorea cymosula var. cinerea, commonly known as the ash-gray yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are the primary part used. Its tubers are often used as a food source and have been traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities. The ash-gray coloration of the plant is due to the presence of a dense covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves."
