    "intro": "Dioscorea lacerdaei, commonly known as the Brazilian yam, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in tendrils that aid in climbing. This species is valued for its starchy tubers, which are a traditional food source in some indigenous communities."
