    "intro": "Drosera erythrogyne, commonly known as the red-stem sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish stems and sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are short and often form a rosette, with the sticky secretions on the leaf surfaces aiding in insect capture. Drosera erythrogyne is a low-growing perennial that thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
