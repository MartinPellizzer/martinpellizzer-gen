    "intro": "Dalbergia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's ebony, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The fruit is a legume pod that contains several flattened seeds, contributing to its classification within the Fabaceae family."
