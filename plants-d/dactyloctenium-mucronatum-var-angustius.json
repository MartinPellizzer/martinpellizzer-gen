    "intro": "Dactyloctenium mucronatum var. angustius, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in low-nutrient, dry soils, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it a valuable forage plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
