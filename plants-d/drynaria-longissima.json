    "intro": "Drynaria longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Drynaria longissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
