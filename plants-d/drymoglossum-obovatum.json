    "intro": "Drymoglossum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses delicate, obovate-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and delicate species requiring specific environmental conditions for survival."
