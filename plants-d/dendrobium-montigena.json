    "intro": "Dendrobium montigena, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and yellow, are often borne on terminal inflorescences. Dendrobium montigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
