    "intro": "Dryopteris gaoligongensis, commonly known as the Gaoligong Mountain fern, is a species of shield fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests at high elevations. The plant features a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery rachis and lance-shaped pinnae. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
