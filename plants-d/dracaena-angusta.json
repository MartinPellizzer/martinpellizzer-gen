    "intro": "Dracaena angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that grow in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in terminal panicles, often followed by bright red berries. Dracaena angusta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
