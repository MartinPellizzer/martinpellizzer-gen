    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to other varieties of Deschampsia. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
