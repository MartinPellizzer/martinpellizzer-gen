It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
