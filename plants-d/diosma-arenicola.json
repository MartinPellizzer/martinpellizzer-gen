    "intro": "Diosma arenicola, commonly known as the sand diosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Diosma arenicola is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
