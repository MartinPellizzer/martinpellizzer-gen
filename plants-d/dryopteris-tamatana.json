    "intro": "Dryopteris tamatana, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
