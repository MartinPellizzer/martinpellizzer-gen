    "intro": "Drymophloeus vestiarius, commonly known as the white-veined screw-pine, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a small tree or shrub with a distinctive, rugged appearance and a woody stem that is often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a unique white-veined pattern that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it an important component of tropical coastal ecosystems."
