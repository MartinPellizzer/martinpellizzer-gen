    "intro": "Dianthus humilis, commonly known as the creeping pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive frilled edge. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus humilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
