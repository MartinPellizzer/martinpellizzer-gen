    "intro": "Damasonium stellatum subsp. polyspermum, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in shallow water or damp soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
