    "intro": "Dendrobium johannis, commonly known as the John's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Dendrobium johannis thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
