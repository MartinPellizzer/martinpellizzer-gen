    "intro": "Dryopteris fuliginosa, commonly known as the black knight fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fertile fronds that contrast with its lighter, more delicate sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense, clumping colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive, almost zigzag appearance due to the arrangement of the pinnae."
