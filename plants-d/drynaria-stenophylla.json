    "intro": "Drynaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant that forms a tall, slender trunk with a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk covered in a layer of old, dead fronds that provide a protective sheath. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a delicate, fern-like appearance. Drynaria stenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments."
