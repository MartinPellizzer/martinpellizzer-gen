    "intro": "Dicranopteris dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually small and clustered, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
