    "intro": "Dryopteris paomowanensis, commonly known as the Paomowan Shield Fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant exhibits a complex frond structure, with a long, slender rachis and lanceolate pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
