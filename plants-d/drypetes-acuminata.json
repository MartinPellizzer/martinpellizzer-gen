    "intro": "Drypetes acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its durability, it is sometimes used in traditional construction and as a source of timber."
