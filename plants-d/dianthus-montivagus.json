    "intro": "Dianthus montivagus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Dianthus montivagus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats."
