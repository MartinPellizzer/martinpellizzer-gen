    "intro": "Dryopteris mirabilis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The fronds are divided into numerous segments, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
