    "intro": "Danthonia oresigena, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Danthonia oresigena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
