    "intro": "Dacryodes papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown to black bark and its large, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single large seed. Dacryodes papuana is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and as a source of timber. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
