It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
