    "intro": "Didesmus bipinnatus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate fern, is a deciduous fern native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a tall, slender rhizome and produces large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and are divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant, feathery appearance."
