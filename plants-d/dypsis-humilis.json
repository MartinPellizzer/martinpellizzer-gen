    "intro": "Dypsis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf areca palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to Madagascar. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous sheath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, edible fruits. Its foliage consists of feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Dypsis humilis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
