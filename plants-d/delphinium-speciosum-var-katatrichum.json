    "intro": "Delphinium speciosum var. katatrichum, commonly known as the Katatrichum larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
