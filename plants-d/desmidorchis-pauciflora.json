    "intro": "Desmidorchis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short-lived, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a faintly colored lip, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
