    "intro": "Dryopteris evoluta, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that gives the plant its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusium. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
