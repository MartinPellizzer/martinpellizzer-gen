    "intro": "Dennstaedtia arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, tree-like appearance. It features a central, unbranched stem covered in a dense mass of roots, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. The plant has large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically green and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique structure and appearance make it a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
