    "intro": "Deyeuxia autumnalis var. microtis, commonly known as autumn false rice, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties of Deyeuxia."
