    "intro": "Dipteryx pteropus, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a towering tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces woody, angular pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. The tree has a deep root system and can live for hundreds of years, playing a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem. Its flowers are small and green, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The Brazil nut tree is also valued for its timber, though its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss."
