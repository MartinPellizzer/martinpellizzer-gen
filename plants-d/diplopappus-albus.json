    "intro": "Diplopappus albus, commonly known as the white burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed structures. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a two-part pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Diplopappus albus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
