    "intro": "Downingia elegans var. corymbosa, commonly known as the Sierra pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial species characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for alpine and coastal gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The Sierra pink is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
