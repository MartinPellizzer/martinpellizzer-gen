It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Digitaria scalarum is valued for its ornamental use and as a forage crop in some regions."
