It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous horizontal, leafy stems that often trail from trees or grow on the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
