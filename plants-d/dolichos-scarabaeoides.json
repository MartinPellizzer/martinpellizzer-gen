    "intro": "Dolichos scarabaeoides, commonly known as the scarab bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being elliptical and pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and fiber levels. Dolichos scarabaeoides is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some parts of the world."
