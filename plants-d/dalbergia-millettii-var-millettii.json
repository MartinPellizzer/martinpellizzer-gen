    "intro": "Dalbergia millettii var. millettii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color and a fine, even texture. The plant has opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by flat, winged fruits. This species is valued for its high-quality timber but is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
