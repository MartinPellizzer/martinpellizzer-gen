    "intro": "Danthonia macrantha, commonly known as the tall grass muhly, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it is drought-tolerant. Danthonia macrantha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
