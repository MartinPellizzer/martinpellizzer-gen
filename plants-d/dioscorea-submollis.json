    "intro": "Dioscorea submollis, commonly known as the smooth yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the economically important part, are used as a food source in some regions. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, contributing to its common name."
