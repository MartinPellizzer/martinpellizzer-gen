    "intro": "Driessenia hirta, commonly known as the hairy driessenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
