    "intro": "Doryopteris humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or high-altitude habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Doryopteris humbertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
