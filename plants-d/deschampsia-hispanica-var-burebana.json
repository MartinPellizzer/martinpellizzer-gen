    "intro": "Deschampsia hispanica var. burebana, commonly known as Spanish hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
