    "intro": "Deinostema adenocaula, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Deinostema adenocaula plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
