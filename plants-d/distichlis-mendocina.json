    "intro": "Distichlis mendocina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Distichlis mendocina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
