    "intro": "Dryopteris tibangensis, commonly known as the Tibang cliff fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to steep slopes and cliffs. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
