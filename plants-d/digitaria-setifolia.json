    "intro": "Digitaria setifolia, commonly known as silvergrass or curlytop grass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions. Digitaria setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
