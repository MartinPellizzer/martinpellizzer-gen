    "intro": "Doryopteris baturitensis, commonly known as the Baturite fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Doryopteris baturitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
