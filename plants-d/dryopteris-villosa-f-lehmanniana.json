    "intro": "Dryopteris villosa f. lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's hairy wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, particularly China. The plant features lanceolate to ovate-shaped leaves with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence on its fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
