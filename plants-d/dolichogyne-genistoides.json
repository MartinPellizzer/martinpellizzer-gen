    "intro": "Dolichogyne genistoides, commonly known as the creeping goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
