    "intro": "Davallia alata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a dark green color with a glossy surface. Davallia alata prefers indirect light and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
