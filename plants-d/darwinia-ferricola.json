    "intro": "Darwinia ferricola, commonly known as the ironwood darwinia, is a unique shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped flower spikes that range in color from red to pink, adding visual interest to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a lush green backdrop to the vibrant floral display. Darwinia ferricola is well adapted to the harsh, Mediterranean climate of its native environment, showing resilience to drought and fire."
