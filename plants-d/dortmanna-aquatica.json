    "intro": "Dortmanna aquatica, commonly known as water sparrowgrass, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, narrow leaves arranged spirally. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish in color. Dortmanna aquatica plays a role in maintaining water clarity by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
