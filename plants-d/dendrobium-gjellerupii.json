    "intro": "Dendrobium gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
