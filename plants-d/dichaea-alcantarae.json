    "intro": "Dichaea alcantarae, commonly known as the Alcantara's dwarf bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and are typically white or pale green. Dichaea alcantarae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
