    "intro": "Dahlia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf dahlia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features showy, single or double flowers in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and white. The plant has tuberous roots that store nutrients and allow it to survive in dormant states during unfavorable conditions. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Dahlia pusilla is well-suited for garden borders and containers due to its small size and ornamental value."
