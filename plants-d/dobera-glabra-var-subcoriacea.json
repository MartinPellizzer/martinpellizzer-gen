    "intro": "Dobera glabra var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the smooth dobera, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features lanceolate leaves that are glabrous on the upper surface and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators. Its woody stem is covered with a thick, corky layer, providing structural support and drought resistance. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
