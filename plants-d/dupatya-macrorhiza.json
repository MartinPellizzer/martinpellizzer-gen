    "intro": "Dupatya macrorhiza, commonly known as the broad-rooted fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Dupatya macrorhiza is often found in forest understories, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
