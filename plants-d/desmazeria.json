    "intro": "Desmazeria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Desmazeria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to their attractive appearance."
