    "intro": "Didiplis diandra, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Didiplis diandra is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
