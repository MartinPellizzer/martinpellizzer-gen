    "intro": "Diplazium megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, forested areas."
