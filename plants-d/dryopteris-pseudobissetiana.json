    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudobissetiana, commonly known as the Bisset's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its foliage. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
