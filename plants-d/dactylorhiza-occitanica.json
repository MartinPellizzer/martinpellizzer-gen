    "intro": "Dactylorhiza occitanica, commonly known as the Southern Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear several showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths, often growing in acidic soils. Dactylorhiza occitanica is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer."
