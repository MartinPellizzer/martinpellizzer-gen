    "intro": "Dendrobium megalanthum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces large, showy flowers that can be pink, red, or white, often with intricate patterns. Its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium megalanthum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
