    "intro": "Desmodium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with slender, elongated leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive burrs, which are composed of inflated, seed-containing pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Desmodium angustifolium is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
