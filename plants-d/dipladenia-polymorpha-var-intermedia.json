    "intro": "Dipladenia polymorpha var. intermedia, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a vigorous trailing or climbing plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange, red, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions."
