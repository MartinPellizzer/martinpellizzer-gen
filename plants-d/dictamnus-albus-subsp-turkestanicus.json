    "intro": "Dictamnus albus subsp. turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan white dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, often citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its stems are often covered with fine, whitish hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions across its native range."
