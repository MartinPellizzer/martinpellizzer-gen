    "intro": "Dendrophorbium coroicense, commonly known as the Coro Island tree, is a unique plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually small and clustered. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
