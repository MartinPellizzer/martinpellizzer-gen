    "intro": "Dryopteris scolopendrioides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time."
