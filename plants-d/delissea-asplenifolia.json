    "intro": "Delissea asplenifolia, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Delissea asplenifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique texture."
