    "intro": "Daucus biseriatus, commonly known as the two-seeded parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and celery. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-chambered structure containing two seeds, hence its common name. Daucus biseriatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental and culinary potential."
