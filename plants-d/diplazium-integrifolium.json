    "intro": "Diplazium integrifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and entire leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae. Diplazium integrifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
