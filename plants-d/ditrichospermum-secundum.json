    "intro": "Ditrichospermum secundum, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in cyathia. Despite its ornamental potential, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
