    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. schustleri, commonly known as the Schustler's dactylis, is a rare and distinctive variant of the dactylis genus. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphological features, including variations in leaf structure and flowering patterns. This form is of interest to taxonomists and botanists due to its distinct genetic and phenotypic traits."
