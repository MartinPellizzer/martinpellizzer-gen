    "intro": "Dubautia laxa subsp. pseudoplantaginea, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 dudleya, is a succulent shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky areas on mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
