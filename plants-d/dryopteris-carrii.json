    "intro": "Dryopteris carrii, commonly known as the Carri's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, fern-like structure that gives the plant its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
