It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit with fine, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
