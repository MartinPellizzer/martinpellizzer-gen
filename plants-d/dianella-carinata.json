    "intro": "Dianella carinata, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a perennial evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are narrow and strap-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Dianella carinata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its traditional uses by M\u0101ori people."
