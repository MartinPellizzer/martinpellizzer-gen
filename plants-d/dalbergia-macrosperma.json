    "intro": "Dalbergia macrosperma, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical legume native to central and southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense, dark green canopy. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and the flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in racemes. The tree produces hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its fine grain and rich color, making it a prized material in furniture and musical instrument manufacturing. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
