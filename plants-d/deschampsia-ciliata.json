    "intro": "Deschampsia ciliata, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-blue foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. Deschampsia ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
