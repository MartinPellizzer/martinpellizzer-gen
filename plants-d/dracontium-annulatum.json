    "intro": "Dracontium annulatum, commonly known as the ringed arum, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it can be toxic if ingested."
