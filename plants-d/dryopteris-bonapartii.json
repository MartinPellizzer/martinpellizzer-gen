    "intro": "Dryopteris bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
