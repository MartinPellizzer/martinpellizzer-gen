    "intro": "Dasylirion strictum, commonly known as the rigid sotol, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, rosette-like clusters. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white to pale green flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
