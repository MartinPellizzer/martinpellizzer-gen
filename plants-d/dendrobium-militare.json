    "intro": "Dendrobium militare, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a metallic sheen. Its flowers are showy, with a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, and are borne on racemes. Dendrobium militare thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
