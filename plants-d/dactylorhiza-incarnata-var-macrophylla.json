    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and the flowers are usually purple or pink in color. This orchid is a perennial, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in its moist environment."
