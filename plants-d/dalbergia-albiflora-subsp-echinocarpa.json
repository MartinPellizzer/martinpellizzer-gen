    "intro": "Dalbergia albiflora subsp. echinocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered ironwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, heavy wood and distinctive white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
