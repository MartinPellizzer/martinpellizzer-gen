    "intro": "Dudleya saxosa, commonly known as the coastal Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
