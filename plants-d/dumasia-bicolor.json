    "intro": "Dumasia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored dwarf lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. Dumasia bicolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and ability to bloom multiple times throughout the growing season."
