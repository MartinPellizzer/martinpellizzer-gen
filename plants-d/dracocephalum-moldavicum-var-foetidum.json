It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its strong, pungent odor, it is sometimes referred to as the \"stinking\" variety of its species."
