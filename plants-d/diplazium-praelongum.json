    "intro": "Diplazium praelongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Diplazium praelongum is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
