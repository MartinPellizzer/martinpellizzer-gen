    "intro": "Dendrobium sertularioides, commonly known as the coral-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a unique coral-like appearance due to its branched, fleshy stems that resemble coral structures. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
