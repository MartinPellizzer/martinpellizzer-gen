    "intro": "Diplazium urticifolium var. urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like fronds that have a stinging effect when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
