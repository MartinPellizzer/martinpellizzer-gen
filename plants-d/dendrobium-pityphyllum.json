    "intro": "Dendrobium pityphyllum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium pityphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
