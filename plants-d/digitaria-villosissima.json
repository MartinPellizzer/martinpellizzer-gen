    "intro": "Digitaria villosissima, commonly known as hairy Digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Digitaria villosissima is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
