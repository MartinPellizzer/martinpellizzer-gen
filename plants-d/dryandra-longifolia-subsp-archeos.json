    "intro": "Dryandra longifolia subsp. archeos, commonly known as the ancient dryandra, is a rare and endangered shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is found in heathland and sandplain environments. Its conservation status highlights the need for habitat protection due to habitat loss and land clearing. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
