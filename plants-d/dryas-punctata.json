    "intro": "Dryas punctata, commonly known as the alpine drumstick or mountain avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is adapted to cold, harsh environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Dryas punctata plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing food for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
