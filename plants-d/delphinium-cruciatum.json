    "intro": "Delphinium cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-flower larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, cross-shaped flowers, which give it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Delphinium cruciatum is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
