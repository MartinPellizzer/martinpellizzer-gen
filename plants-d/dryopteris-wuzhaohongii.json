    "intro": "Dryopteris wuzhaohongii, commonly known as the Wuzhaohong shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
