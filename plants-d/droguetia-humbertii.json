    "intro": "Droguetia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's droguetia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in humid conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
