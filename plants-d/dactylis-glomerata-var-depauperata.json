    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass, is a variant of the common tufted grass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, dense spikelets that form clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
