    "intro": "Dryopteris damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain wood fern, is a rare species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex, lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
