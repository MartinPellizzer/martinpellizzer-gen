    "intro": "Dalea radicans, commonly known as creeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are pinnately divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea radicans thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas."
