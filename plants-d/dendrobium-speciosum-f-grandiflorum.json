    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum f. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. Its blooms, which can be white, yellow, or pink, are typically large and occur in late winter to early spring. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
