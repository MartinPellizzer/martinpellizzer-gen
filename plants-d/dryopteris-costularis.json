    "intro": "Dryopteris costularis, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a serrated margin. It produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, attractive colonies."
