    "intro": "Davilla adenophylla, commonly known as the red-leafed huito, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall, and its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
