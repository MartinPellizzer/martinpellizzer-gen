    "intro": "Dolichos littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dolichos, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant features slender, trailing stems with small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or water. Dolichos littoralis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
