    "intro": "Dryopteris bermudiana, commonly known as Bermuda Brake, is a species of fern native to Bermuda and the Bahamas. It is a terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in humid, coastal climates."
