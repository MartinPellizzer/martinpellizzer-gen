    "intro": "Dryopteris ulvensis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
