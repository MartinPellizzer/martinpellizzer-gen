    "intro": "Dendrophthoe locellata, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host trees. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which necessitates its parasitic lifestyle. The plant typically grows as a vine, attaching itself to the bark of its host with specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where suitable host trees are present."
