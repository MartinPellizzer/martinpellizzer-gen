It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of tubular, violet-purple flowers. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, downy hairs. Digitalis rigida is closely related to other foxglove species and contains cardiac glycosides, which have medicinal uses. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
