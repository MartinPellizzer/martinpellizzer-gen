    "intro": "Daucus carota f. roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered carrot, is a horticultural variant of the common carrot. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces edible roots similar to the standard carrot, though they are typically smaller and have a milder flavor. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, while its roots can be used in cooking. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods."
