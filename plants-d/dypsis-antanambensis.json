    "intro": "Dypsis antanambensis, commonly known as the Madagascar bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnately compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
