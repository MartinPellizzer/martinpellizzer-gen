    "intro": "Dryopteris decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the spreading shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or spreading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile fronds producing spores on the underside."
