    "intro": "Dactylorhiza ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common feature among orchids. The species is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
