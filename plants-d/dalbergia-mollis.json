    "intro": "Dalbergia mollis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in musical instrument manufacturing. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its economic importance and conservation status, Dalbergia mollis is a subject of both ecological and commercial interest."
