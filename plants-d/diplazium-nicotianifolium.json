    "intro": "Diplazium nicotianifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of tobacco plants, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium nicotianifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
