    "intro": "Dryopteris subjuncta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread through forest floors. Its sori are clustered in short lines along the margins of the fronds, a feature typical of many Dryopteris species. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in deciduous or mixed hardwood forests."
