It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along watercourses. It has a dense growth habit, making it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its native range."
