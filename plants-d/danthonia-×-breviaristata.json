    "intro": "Danthonia \u00d7 breviaristata, commonly known as the narrowleaf muirgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
