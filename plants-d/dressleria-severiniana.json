    "intro": "Dressleria severiniana, commonly known as the Severin's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces a single inflorescence with several flowers, each featuring a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
