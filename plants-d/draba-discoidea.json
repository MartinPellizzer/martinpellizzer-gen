    "intro": "Draba discoidea, commonly known as the \"buttonweed\" or \"disco flower,\" is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in dense clusters. Draba discoidea is characterized by its short, hairy stems and basal leaves that are usually lobed or divided. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
