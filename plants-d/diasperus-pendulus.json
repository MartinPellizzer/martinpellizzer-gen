    "intro": "Diasperus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging false heather, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its pendulous growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Diasperus pendulus is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
