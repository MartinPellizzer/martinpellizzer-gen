    "intro": "Davallia imbricata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination process."
