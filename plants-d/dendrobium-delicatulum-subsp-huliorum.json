    "intro": "Dendrobium delicatulum subsp. huliorum, commonly known as the Hulio Orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments with good air circulation. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
