    "intro": "Davallia chaerophylla, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, compact fern with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive silvery vein pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Davallia chaerophylla is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements."
