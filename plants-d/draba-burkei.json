    "intro": "Draba burkei, commonly known as Burke's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba burkei produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
