    "intro": "Dysoxylum lenormandianum, commonly known as the Madagascar sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its hard, fragrant wood, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
