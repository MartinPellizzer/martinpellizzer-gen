    "intro": "Dolichos luticola, commonly known as the water bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Dolichos luticola is often found growing near water bodies, such as rivers and lakes, due to its preference for moist soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
