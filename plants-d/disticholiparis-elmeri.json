    "intro": "Disticholiparis elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's disticholiparis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-rowed arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate indirect light. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
