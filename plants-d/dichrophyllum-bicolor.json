    "intro": "Dichrophyllum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored fern, is a unique plant characterized by its striking color variation. It features leaves that display two distinct colors, typically green and brown, creating an eye-catching visual effect. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare botanical feature makes Dichrophyllum bicolor a subject of scientific interest and botanical wonder."
