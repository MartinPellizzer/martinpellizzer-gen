    "intro": "Disocactus \u00d7 violaceus, commonly known as the Purple Angel's Wings, is a hybrid cactus species that combines traits from its parent species, Disocactus phyllostrobis and Disocactus flagelliformis. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features thick, segmented stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
