    "intro": "Diadenaria psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred mushroom or the hallucinogenic truffle, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy, and often brightly colored fruiting body, which can range from white to yellow or orange in hue. The cap is typically small, with a smooth or slightly sticky surface, and the stem is short and robust. This fungus is known for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly psilocybin and psilocin, which contribute to its hallucinogenic effects. It is often found in association with certain trees, such as oaks and pines, in temperate regions."
