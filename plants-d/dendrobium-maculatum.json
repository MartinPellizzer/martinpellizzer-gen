It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with distinctive dark markings. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium maculatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
