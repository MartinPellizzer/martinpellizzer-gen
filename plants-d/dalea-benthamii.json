    "intro": "Dalea benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea benthamii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
