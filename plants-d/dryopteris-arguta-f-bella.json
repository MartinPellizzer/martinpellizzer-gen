It is a compact, clump-forming plant with fronds that are typically arched and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. The fronds are usually deciduous, turning bronze in autumn before shedding."
