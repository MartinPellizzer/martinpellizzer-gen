It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods containing small, round seeds that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm climates and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules enhances soil fertility."
