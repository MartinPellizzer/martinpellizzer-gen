    "intro": "Dryopteris fuyangensis, commonly known as the Fuyang shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
