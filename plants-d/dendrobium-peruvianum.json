    "intro": "Dendrobium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium peruvianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
