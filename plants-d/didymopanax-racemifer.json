    "intro": "Didymopanax racemifer, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it requires careful care and is not commonly found in the wild."
