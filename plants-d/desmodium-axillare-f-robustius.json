    "intro": "Desmodium axillare f. robustius, commonly known as the robust lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its dense root system. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural settings."
