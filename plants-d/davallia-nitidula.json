    "intro": "Davallia nitidula, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense clumps, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
