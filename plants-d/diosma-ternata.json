    "intro": "Diosma ternata, commonly known as the three-leafed diosma, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Diosma ternata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
