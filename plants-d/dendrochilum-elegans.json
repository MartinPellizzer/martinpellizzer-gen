    "intro": "Dendrochilum elegans, commonly known as the elegant tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrochilum elegans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
