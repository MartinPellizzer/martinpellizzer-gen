    "intro": "Dysoxylum cyrtobotryum f. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits. This species is often found in lowland and hill forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
