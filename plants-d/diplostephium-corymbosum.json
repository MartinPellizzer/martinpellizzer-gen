It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a tall, branching stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow ray flowers surrounded by disk flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a drought-tolerant plant adapted to arid climates."
