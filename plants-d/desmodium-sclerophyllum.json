    "intro": "Desmodium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with stiff, leathery leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Desmodium sclerophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
