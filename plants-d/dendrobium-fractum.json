    "intro": "Dendrobium fractum, commonly known as the broken-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that are often branched and covered in clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium fractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, colorful blooms."
