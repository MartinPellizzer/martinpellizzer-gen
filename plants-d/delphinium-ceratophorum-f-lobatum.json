    "intro": "Delphinium ceratophorum f. lobatum, commonly known as the lobed delphinium, is a hybrid form of the delphinium genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while the lobed form refers to the distinctive, split appearance of its foliage. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
