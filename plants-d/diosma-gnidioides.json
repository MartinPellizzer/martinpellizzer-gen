    "intro": "Diosma gnidioides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Diosma gnidioides is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
