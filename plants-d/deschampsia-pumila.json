    "intro": "Deschampsia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture. Deschampsia pumila is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
