    "intro": "Dendrobium luzonense, commonly known as the Luzon orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its erect, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium luzonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
