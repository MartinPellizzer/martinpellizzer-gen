It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded forest habitats. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in low-light conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
