    "intro": "Dactylorhiza savogiensis f. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean marsh orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its morphology includes strap-like leaves and a distinctive, spurred labellum that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
