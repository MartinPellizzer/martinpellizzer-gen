    "intro": "Dracaena laxissima f. aureilicia, commonly known as the golden dracaena, is a varietal form of the dracaena plant characterized by its striking golden-yellow variegation on its leaves. This plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. The leaves are long, narrow, and grow in a rosette pattern, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The golden dracaena is also known for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
