    "intro": "Dryopteris distantipinna, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
