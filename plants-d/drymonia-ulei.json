    "intro": "Drymonia ulei, commonly known as the white sand pine, is a shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
