It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in cool, humid environments, relying on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Dendrobium alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
