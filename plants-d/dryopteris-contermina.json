    "intro": "Dryopteris contermina, commonly known as the mountain barren fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its fronds are usually short and broad, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Dryopteris contermina is a hardy plant that thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 6,000 feet."
