    "intro": "Dicliptera carvalhoi subsp. erinacea, commonly known as the erinaceus dicliptera, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often found in shaded undergrowth. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is adapted to humid, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
