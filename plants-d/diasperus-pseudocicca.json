    "intro": "Diasperus pseudocicca, commonly known as the false cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
