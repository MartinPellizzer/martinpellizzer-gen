    "intro": "Diacidia galphimioides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's foliage. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large areas of the host tree's canopy. It produces small, white or pale green berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is often considered a threat to forest health."
