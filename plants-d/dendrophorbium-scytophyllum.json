    "intro": "Dendrophorbium scytophyllum, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a unique lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, often appearing as a yellowish or orange-colored patch. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on the trunks of deciduous trees in temperate regions. This lichen plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
