    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. villosa, commonly known as hairy heartleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
