    "intro": "Dryopteris eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
