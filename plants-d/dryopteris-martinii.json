    "intro": "Dryopteris martinii, commonly known as the Martin's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
