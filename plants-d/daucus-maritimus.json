    "intro": "Daucus maritimus, commonly known as sea parsley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating saline conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a parsley-like scent, while its small white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Daucus maritimus plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects."
