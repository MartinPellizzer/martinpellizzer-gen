    "intro": "Dinemandra ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Dinemandra ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife."
