    "intro": "Dendrobium cleistanthum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
