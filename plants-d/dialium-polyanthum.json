    "intro": "Dialium polyanthum, commonly known as the fragrant ivory nut, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine."
