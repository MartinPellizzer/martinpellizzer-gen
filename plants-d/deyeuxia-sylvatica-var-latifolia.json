    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally broader than the typical species of the genus Deyeuxia. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
