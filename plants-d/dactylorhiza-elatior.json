    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elatior, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and riverbanks. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting a dense spike of pale to deep purple flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Dactylorhiza elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
