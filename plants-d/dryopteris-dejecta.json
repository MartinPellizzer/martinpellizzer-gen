    "intro": "Dryopteris dejecta, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, tree-like appearance. It features a thick, leathery rhizome that serves as a base for its fronds, which are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees or other surfaces. Its fronds are usually a deep green, with a rough texture that resembles the hide of a stag. Dryopteris dejecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
