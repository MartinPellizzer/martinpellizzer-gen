    "intro": "Dendrobium appendiculiforme, commonly known as the appendiculate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive appendage at the base of the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
