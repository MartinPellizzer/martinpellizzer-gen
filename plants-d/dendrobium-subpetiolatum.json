    "intro": "Dendrobium subpetiolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it has narrow, strap-like leaves. It blooms with clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that are often adorned with purple or pink markings. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
