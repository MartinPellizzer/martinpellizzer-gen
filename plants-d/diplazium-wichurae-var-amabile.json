    "intro": "Diplazium wichurae var. amabile, commonly known as the pink fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that often display a striking pinkish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually erect and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive ornamental plant."
