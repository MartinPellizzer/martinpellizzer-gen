    "intro": "Dracophyllum \u00d7 vulcanicum, commonly known as the hybrid dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the local flora in volcanic landscapes."
