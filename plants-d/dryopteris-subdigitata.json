    "intro": "Dryopteris subdigitata, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
