    "intro": "Dendrobium gracilicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem that can grow up to several feet in length, often adorned with small, clustered flowers. The plant produces delicate, fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. Dendrobium gracilicaule thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
