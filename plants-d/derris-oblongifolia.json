The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has insecticidal effects. Derris oblongifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
