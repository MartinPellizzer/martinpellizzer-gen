    "intro": "Danthonia setacea, commonly known as the tufted grass or slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or beige in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Danthonia setacea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
