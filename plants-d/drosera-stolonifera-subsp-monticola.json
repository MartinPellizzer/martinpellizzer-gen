    "intro": "Drosera stolonifera subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its natural habitat."
