    "intro": "Draba integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally smooth and entire, giving it its scientific name, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba integrifolia is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
