    "intro": "Dyckia warmingii, commonly known as the Cape York dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, specifically found in Brazil and Paraguay. This plant is characterized by its rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette."
