    "intro": "Diplazium spinosum, commonly known as the spinous water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis."
