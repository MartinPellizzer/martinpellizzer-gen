    "intro": "Ditassa ayangannensis, commonly known as the Ayangannensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in its native habitat. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its forest ecosystem."
