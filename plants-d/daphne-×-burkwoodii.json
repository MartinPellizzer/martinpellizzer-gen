    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 burkwoodii, commonly known as the Burkwood daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the United Kingdom. It features fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
