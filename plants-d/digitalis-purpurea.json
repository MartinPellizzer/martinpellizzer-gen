    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea, commonly known as the foxglove, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spires of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink and white. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic but have been historically used in medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which contributes to its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Digitalis purpurea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
