    "intro": "Dicksonia decurrens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper portion being dark green and the lower part silvery-white, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional M\u0101ori practices."
