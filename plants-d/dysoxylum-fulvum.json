    "intro": "Dysoxylum fulvum, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant is often found in coastal areas, thriving in brackish or saline water due to its adaptive root systems. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellowish color, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
