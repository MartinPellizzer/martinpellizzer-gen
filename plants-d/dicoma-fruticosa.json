    "intro": "Dicoma fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow karoo bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its compact, woody structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a bright splash of color to its harsh environment. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dicoma fruticosa is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
