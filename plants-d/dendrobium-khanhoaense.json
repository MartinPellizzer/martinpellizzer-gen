    "intro": "Dendrobium khanhoaense, commonly known as the Khanhoa orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes numerous species of orchids characterized by their sympodial growth habit. The plant typically features long, thin stems that can be either erect or hanging, and it produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
