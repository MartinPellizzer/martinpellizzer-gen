    "intro": "Digitaria robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is adapted to saturated soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
