    "intro": "Dactylis peylii, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Dactylis peylii is also used in some horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various climates."
