    "intro": "Dalbergia ikopensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and functional properties. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume pods containing flat, lens-shaped seeds. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, it is also considered a species of concern in some regions."
