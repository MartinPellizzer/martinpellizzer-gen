    "intro": "Diplusodon lanceolatus f. foliosus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. It is a herbaceous plant with a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a cluster of small, yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which aid in water retention. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly seen in gardens and along roadsides."
