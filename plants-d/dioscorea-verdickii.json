It is a climbing perennial vine characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Dioscorea verdickii is valued for its edible tubers, which are a traditional food source in many African communities."
