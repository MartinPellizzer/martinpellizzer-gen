    "intro": "Diervilla diervilla, commonly known as American hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant red in the fall. Diervilla diervilla thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
