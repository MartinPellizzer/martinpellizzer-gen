    "intro": "Dianella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered flax lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Dianella parviflora is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
