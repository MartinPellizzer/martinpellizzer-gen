    "intro": "Dicranopteris orthoclada, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Dicranopteris orthoclada plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
