    "intro": "Dendrobium dalleizettii, commonly known as the Ceylon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet zones of Sri Lanka. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces multiple pseudobulbs, each topped with a single leaf. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
