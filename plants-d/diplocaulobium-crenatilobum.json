It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually green and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions."
