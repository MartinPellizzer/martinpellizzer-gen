    "intro": "Dalbergia stipulacea var. mogkokensis, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood with a high density. The plant features compound leaves with stipules, and its flowers are small and clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine forests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
