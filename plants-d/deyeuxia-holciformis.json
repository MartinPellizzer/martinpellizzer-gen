    "intro": "Deyeuxia holciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Deyeuxia holciformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
