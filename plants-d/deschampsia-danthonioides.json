    "intro": "Deschampsia danthonioides, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its slender, tufted inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Deschampsia danthonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
