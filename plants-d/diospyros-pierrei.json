    "intro": "Diospyros pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that give way to orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, though often considered astringent, and is used in local traditional medicine and cuisine. Diospyros pierrei thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils."
