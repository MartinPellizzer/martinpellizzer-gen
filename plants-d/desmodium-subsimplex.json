    "intro": "Desmodium subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiny, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmodium subsimplex plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
