    "intro": "Dentaria laciniata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf toothplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a wavy or serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by yellow, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
