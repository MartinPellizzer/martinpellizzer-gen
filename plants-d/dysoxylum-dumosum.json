    "intro": "Dysoxylum dumosum, commonly known as the bushy mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and is often found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Dysoxylum dumosum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
