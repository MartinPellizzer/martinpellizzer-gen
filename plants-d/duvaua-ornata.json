    "intro": "Duvaua ornata, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Duvaua ornata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
