    "intro": "Decodon salicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and improve water quality. Decodon salicifolius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
