    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 illustre, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or gold in color, with a fragrant aroma, and bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
