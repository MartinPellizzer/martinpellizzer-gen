    "intro": "Dryopteris eurostotricha, commonly known as the European shield fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Dryopteris eurostotricha is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
