It is a legume, belonging to the family Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, twisted pod, which aids in seed dispersal."
