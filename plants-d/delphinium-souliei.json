    "intro": "Delphinium souliei, commonly known as the Chinese larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
