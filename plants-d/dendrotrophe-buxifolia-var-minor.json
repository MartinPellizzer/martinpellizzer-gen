    "intro": "Dendrotrophe buxifolia var. minor, commonly known as the miniature boxwood tree, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery to the touch. The plant produces inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its neat, rounded form and its ability to maintain a compact size with minimal pruning."
