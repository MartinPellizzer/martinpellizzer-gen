    "intro": "Draba hirta var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are hairy and basal, forming a dense rosette to protect against harsh weather conditions. Draba hirta var. genuina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats."
