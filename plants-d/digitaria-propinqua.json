    "intro": "Digitaria propinqua, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Digitaria propinqua is often considered a wetland indicator species due to its specific habitat preferences."
