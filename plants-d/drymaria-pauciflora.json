    "intro": "Drymaria pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Drymaria pauciflora is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of dryland vegetation."
