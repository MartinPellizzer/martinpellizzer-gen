    "intro": "Distylium gracile, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. Distylium gracile is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
