    "intro": "Dendrobium smillieae, commonly known as the smillie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and they bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium smillieae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
