    "intro": "Disporum bodinieri, commonly known as the Chinese yew or Bodinier's yew, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
