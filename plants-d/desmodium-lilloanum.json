    "intro": "Desmodium lilloanum, commonly known as the slender desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
