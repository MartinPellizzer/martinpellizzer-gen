    "intro": "Danthonia villosa var. glomerata, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered in loose to dense panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
