    "intro": "Dendrobium neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dendrobium neoguineense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
