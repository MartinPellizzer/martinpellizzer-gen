    "intro": "Dicorynia guianensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its buttressed roots that provide stability in the nutrient-poor soil. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain multiple seeds, each encased in a hard shell. These seeds are the edible Brazil nuts, which are commercially valuable. The plant also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
