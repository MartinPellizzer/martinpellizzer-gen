    "intro": "Diodia polymorpha var. macrophylla, commonly known as large-leaf diodia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. The species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in native plant gardens."
