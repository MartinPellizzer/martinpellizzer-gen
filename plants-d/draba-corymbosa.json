    "intro": "Draba corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Draba corymbosa typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a mat-like growth pattern. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its natural habitat."
