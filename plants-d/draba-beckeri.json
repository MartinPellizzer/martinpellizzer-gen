    "intro": "Draba beckeri, commonly known as the Becker's whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Draba beckeri produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to the cold, arid climates of its native habitat."
