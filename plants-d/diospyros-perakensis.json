    "intro": "Diospyros perakensis, commonly known as the Malayan persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. The fruit's skin is thin and easily removed, revealing a sweet, edible pulp with a texture similar to a persimmon. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
