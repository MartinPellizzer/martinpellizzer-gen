    "intro": "Dianthus callizonus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from pink to red. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Dianthus callizonus is often found in sandy soils and is a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
