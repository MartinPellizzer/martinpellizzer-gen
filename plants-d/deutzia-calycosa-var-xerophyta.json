    "intro": "Deutzia calycosa var. xerophyta, commonly known as the desert deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
