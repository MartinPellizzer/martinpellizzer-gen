    "intro": "Daphne paxiana, commonly known as the Persian daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western and central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Daphne paxiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and winter interest."
