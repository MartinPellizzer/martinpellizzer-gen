    "intro": "Didymoglossum muscoides, commonly known as the small moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, closely packed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaf structure features a distinct costa, which is a midrib that extends the length of the leaf. Didymoglossum muscoides is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to withstand periods of desiccation."
