    "intro": "Dacryodes peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
