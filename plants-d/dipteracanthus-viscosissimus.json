    "intro": "Dipteracanthus viscosissimus, commonly known as the sticky dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical tree species. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that exude a sticky substance, likely as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a combination of yellow and red hues. The sticky resin produced by the plant has been studied for its potential medicinal and industrial applications."
