    "intro": "Dermasea nivalis, commonly known as the snowskin lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps protect it from freezing temperatures. The lichen forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide it with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in alpine and Arctic regions. Due to its delicate structure, Dermasea nivalis is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
