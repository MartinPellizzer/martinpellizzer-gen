    "intro": "Draba monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Basin Draba, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Mono Lake Basin in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a low, mat-forming growth habit with basal leaves and produces yellow or white flowers in early spring. Draba monoensis is also known for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions with limited soil and moisture."
