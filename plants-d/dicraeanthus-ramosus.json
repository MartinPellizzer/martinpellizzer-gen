It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often exhibit a zigzag or twisted appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Dicraeanthus ramosus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental stems and unique growth habit."
