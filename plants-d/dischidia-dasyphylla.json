    "intro": "Dischidia dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly shield vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a climbing or trailing plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
