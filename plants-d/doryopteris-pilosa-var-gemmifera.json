    "intro": "Doryopteris pilosa var. gemmifera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The varietal form gemmifera is notable for its ability to propagate through gemmae, small vegetative propagules that allow for rapid colony formation."
