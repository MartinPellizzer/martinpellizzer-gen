    "intro": "Deschampsia eminens var. discreta, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. This variant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in open meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing light-colored florets that are adapted for wind pollination. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
