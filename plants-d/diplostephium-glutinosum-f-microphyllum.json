    "intro": "Diplostephium glutinosum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved sticky nightshade, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small, sticky leaves and showy flowers make it a distinctive species within its genus. Due to its unique morphology, it is often studied for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
