    "intro": "Dracophyllum matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthew's dracophyllum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cool, humid forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which appear in late spring to early summer. Dracophyllum matthewsii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. It is often found in association with other native New Zealand flora in forest understories."
