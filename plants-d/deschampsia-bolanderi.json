    "intro": "Deschampsia bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually pale green to brown in color. Bolander's feathergrass is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
