    "intro": "Dendrobium fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the dry season. The plant has a unique growth habit, with long, wiry stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered one of the most challenging orchids to cultivate."
