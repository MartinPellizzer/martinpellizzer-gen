    "intro": "Deyeuxia cajatambensis, commonly known as the Cajatamb\u00e9 grass, is a species of perennial grass native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in areas with high humidity and saturated soils. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is a branched cluster of small flowers, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia cajatambensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to aquatic habitats."
