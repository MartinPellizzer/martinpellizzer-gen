    "intro": "Dracocephalum chamaedryoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and showy, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a square stem typical of many members of this family. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs that give them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
