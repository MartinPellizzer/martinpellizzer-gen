    "intro": "Distimake nervosus, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a delicate herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a lacy appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by clusters of spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The leaves are sensitive to touch, often curling slightly when handled, which contributes to its common name."
