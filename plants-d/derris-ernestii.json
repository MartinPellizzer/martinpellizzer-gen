    "intro": "Derris ernestii, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its root system is notable for containing the alkaloid derrisine, which has been traditionally used in poison arrows. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
