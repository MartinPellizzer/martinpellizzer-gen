    "intro": "Dryopteris yabei var. hololepis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to Japan. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
