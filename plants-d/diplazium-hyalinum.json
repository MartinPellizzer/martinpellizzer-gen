    "intro": "Diplazium hyalinum, commonly known as the silver staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a thick, leathery frond with a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a stag's antlers. Its leaves are covered in a waxy, silvery coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
