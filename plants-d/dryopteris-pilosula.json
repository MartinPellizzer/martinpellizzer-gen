    "intro": "Dryopteris pilosula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
