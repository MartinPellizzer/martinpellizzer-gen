    "intro": "Dendrobium dendrocolla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy roots that store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it blooms during the warmer months. Dendrobium dendrocolla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
