    "intro": "Draba composita, commonly known as the composite rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Draba composita is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
