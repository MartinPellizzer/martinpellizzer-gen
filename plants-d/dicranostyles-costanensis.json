    "intro": "Dicranostyles costanensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate growth form with closely appressed leaves that are usually oval to lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive structures, including the archegonia and antheridia, are located on specialized stalks, typical of liverworts. Dicranostyles costanensis plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitat."
