    "intro": "Dendrobium kempterianum, commonly known as the Kempter\u2019s orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct, fragrant scent. Dendrobium kempterianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
