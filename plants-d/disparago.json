    "intro": "Disparago, commonly known as false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Disparago is often mistaken for true dandelion due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
