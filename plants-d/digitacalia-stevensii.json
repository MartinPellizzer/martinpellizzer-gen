    "intro": "Digitacalia stevensii, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
