    "intro": "Davallia dejoncheerei, commonly known as the Dejoncheere's hameche, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Madagascar. It features leathery, dark green fronds that are pinnately compound, with a unique, narrow shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for once established. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its natural habitat."
