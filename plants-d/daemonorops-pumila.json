    "intro": "Daemonorops pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is a small, slow-growing plant characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
