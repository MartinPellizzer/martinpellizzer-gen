    "intro": "Desmodium caespitosum, commonly known as hairy burr senna, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny areas. Desmodium caespitosum is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields."
