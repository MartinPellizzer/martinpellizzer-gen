It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Dicranopygium dolichostemon plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
