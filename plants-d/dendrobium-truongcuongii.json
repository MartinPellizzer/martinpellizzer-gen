    "intro": "Dendrobium truongcuongii, commonly known as the Truong Cuong orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, typically found on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip petal. It has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
