    "intro": "Diplazium insigne, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Diplazium insigne thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
