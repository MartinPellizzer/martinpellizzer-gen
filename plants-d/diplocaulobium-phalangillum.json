    "intro": "Diplocaulobium phalangillum, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, ovate leaves. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
