    "intro": "Desmanthus pervilleanus, commonly known as the hairy desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Desmanthus pervilleanus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
