    "intro": "Daphnopsis ficina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
