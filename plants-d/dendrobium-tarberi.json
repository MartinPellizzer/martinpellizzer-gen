    "intro": "Dendrobium tarberi, commonly known as the Tarber's orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant features long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural display and scientific study."
