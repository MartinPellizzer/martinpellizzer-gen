    "intro": "Diplazium navarrense, commonly known as Navarre's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. Diplazium navarrense thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high light exposure."
