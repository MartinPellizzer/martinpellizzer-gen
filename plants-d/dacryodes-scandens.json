    "intro": "Dacryodes scandens, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
