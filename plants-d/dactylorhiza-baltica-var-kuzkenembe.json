    "intro": "Dactylorhiza baltica var. kuzkenembe, commonly known as the Kuzkenembe orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, spike-like inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a unique floral structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
