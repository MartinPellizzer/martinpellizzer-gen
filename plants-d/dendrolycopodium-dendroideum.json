    "intro": "Dendrolycopodium dendroideum, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that can grow into a tree-like structure, though it remains a primitive vascular plant. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls that bear spores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats."
