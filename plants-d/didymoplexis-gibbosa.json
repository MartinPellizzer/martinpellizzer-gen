    "intro": "Didymoplexis gibbosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help it climb towards light. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Didymoplexis gibbosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil for optimal growth."
