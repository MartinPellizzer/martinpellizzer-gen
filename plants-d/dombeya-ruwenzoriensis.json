    "intro": "Dombeya ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori dombeya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, cool environments, often near streams or in mountainous forests. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
