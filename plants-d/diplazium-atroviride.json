    "intro": "Diplazium atroviride, commonly known as the dark-green fork fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Diplazium atroviride is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas."
