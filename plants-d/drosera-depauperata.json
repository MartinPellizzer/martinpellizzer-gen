    "intro": "Drosera depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, glandular-tipped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
