    "intro": "Dasylirion wheeleri, commonly known as the Mexican grassland agave, is a robust, evergreen perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
