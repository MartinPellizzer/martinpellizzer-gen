    "intro": "Dendrobium ponapense, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Caroline Islands. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dendrobium ponapense thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation."
