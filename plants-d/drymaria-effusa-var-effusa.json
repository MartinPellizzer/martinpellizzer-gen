    "intro": "Drymaria effusa var. effusa, commonly known as common drymaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in grassy areas and along pathways. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
