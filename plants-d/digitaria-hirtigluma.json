    "intro": "Digitaria hirtigluma, commonly known as hairy digit grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Digitaria hirtigluma is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
