    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea var. africana, commonly known as African burr bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody pods. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. The pods contain seeds that are dispersed by animals and can remain viable for several years."
