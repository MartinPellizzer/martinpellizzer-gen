    "intro": "Dryopteris subimpressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
