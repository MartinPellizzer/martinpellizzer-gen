    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. villosum, commonly known as the hairy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems."
