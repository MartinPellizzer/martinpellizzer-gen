    "intro": "Desmanthus luteus, commonly known as yellow burr clover, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Desmanthus luteus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
