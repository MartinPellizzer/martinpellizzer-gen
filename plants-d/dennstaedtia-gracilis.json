    "intro": "Dennstaedtia gracilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are usually divided into narrow segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance."
