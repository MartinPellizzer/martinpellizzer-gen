It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to the cool, dry climate of its native habitat. Diclidanthera bolivarensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its environment."
