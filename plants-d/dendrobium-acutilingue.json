    "intro": "Dendrobium acutilingue, commonly known as the sharp-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Dendrobium acutilingue is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
