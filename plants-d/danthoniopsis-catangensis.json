    "intro": "Danthoniopsis catangensis, commonly known as the Catangensis muirgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded grassland areas."
