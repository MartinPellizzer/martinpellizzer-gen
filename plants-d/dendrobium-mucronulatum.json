    "intro": "Dendrobium mucronulatum, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Dendrobium mucronulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
