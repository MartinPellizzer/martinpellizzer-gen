    "intro": "Doerpfeldia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. It has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is highly specialized in its ecological requirements. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
