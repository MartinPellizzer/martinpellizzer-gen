    "intro": "Didissandra sericea var. alba, commonly known as the white silky fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation. The varietal name 'alba' refers to its pale, almost white coloration, distinguishing it from other varieties of Didissandra."
