    "intro": "Dracaena xiphophylla, commonly known as the ribbon plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena xiphophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
