It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
