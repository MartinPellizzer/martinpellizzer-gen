    "intro": "Dendrobium azureum, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are striking, with a deep blue hue and a delicate, fragrant aroma. Dendrobium azureum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
