    "intro": "Dryopteris lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Dryopteris lherminieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
