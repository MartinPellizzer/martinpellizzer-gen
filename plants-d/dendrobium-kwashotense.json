It is characterized by its long, wiry stems that often grow horizontally along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
