    "intro": "Dolichothele sphaerica, commonly known as the spherical thread spider, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Dolichotheleidae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated body and long, delicate legs, which are adapted for its arboreal lifestyle. The spider's coloration is typically pale or yellowish, providing it with effective camouflage among foliage. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits trees and shrubs. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Dolichothele sphaerica is considered a rare and less-studied species."
