    "intro": "Deschampsia aciphylla var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and slender, wiry stems that form dense, cushion-like clumps. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, ornamental touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
