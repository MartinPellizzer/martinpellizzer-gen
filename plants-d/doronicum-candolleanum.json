It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Doronicum candolleanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
