    "intro": "Diopogon hirtus, commonly known as the hairy diopogon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that often bear a dense covering of fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Diopogon hirtus is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
