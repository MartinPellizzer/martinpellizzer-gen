    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cocksfoot, is a variant of the common grass species Dactylis glomerata. It is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its growth habit includes forming dense tussocks, which provide habitat for various wildlife species. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters, typical of the grass family Poaceae."
