    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola var. hoeppneri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It thrives in wet, acidic peat bogs and is closely associated with sphagnum moss, which provides the moist, nutrient-poor environment it requires. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are highly adapted to the waterlogged conditions, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened and is protected in many areas."
