    "intro": "Detris fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered detris, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its dense, fascicle-like growth pattern. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, delicate leaves. Its reproductive structures are borne on the upper portions of the stems, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Detris fascicularis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
