    "intro": "Dichelachne hirtella, commonly known as hairy dichelachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense mats near the water's surface. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical arrangements. Dichelachne hirtella plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
