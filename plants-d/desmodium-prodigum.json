    "intro": "Desmodium prodigum, commonly known as the creeping velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It has a sprawling growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Desmodium prodigum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
