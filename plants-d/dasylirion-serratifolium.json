    "intro": "Dasylirion serratifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in sharp, serrated edges. The plant produces large, pendulous clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
