    "intro": "Dendrorkis tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, mosaic-like patterns on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrorkis tessellata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
