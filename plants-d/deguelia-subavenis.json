    "intro": "Deguelia subavenis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the wet season. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich nature. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical regions."
