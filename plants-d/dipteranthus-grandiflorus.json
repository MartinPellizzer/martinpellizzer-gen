    "intro": "Dipteranthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered dipteranthus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
