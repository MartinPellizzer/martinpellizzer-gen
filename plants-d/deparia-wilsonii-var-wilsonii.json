    "intro": "Deparia wilsonii var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the fronds are bi-lobed with a serrated margin. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
