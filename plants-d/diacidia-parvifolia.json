    "intro": "Diacidia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved diacidia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understory habitats. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale green in color. Diacidia parvifolia is characterized by its simple, non-woody structure and is often found in association with other epiphytic and semi-epiphytic plants."
