    "intro": "Drosanthemum anemophilum, commonly known as the wind-pollinated daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a key feature of its reproductive strategy. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, allowing it to store water in arid environments. Drosanthemum anemophilum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
