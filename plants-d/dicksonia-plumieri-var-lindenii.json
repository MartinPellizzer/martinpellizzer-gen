    "intro": "Dicksonia plumieri var. lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, moist soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation in the fern family."
