    "intro": "Dryopteris calva, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, golden-green fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris calva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic quality."
