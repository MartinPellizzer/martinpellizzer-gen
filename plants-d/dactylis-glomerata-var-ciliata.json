    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. ciliata, commonly known as hairy field grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its culms are often erect and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
