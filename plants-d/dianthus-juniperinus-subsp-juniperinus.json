    "intro": "Dianthus juniperinus subsp. juniperinus, commonly known as the Juniper Pink, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that give it a resemblance to juniper, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
