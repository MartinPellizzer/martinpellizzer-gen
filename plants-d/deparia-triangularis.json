    "intro": "Deparia triangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are typically triangular in shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are often used in ornamental gardening. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
