    "intro": "Doellingeria umbellata var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible umbellate grass, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its inflorescence is an umbel, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
