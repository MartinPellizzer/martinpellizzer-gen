    "intro": "Dobera arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. The plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid environment. It is often cultivated in shaded conditions to promote healthy growth and fruit development. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
