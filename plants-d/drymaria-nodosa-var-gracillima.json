    "intro": "Drymaria nodosa var. gracillima, commonly known as slender sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in temperate regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize loose soil. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal dunes, disturbed areas, and dry meadows, showcasing its resilience to harsh environments."
