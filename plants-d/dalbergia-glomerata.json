    "intro": "Dalbergia glomerata, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent, making it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pods containing flat, elongated seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
