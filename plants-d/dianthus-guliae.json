    "intro": "Dianthus guliae, commonly known as the Kashmiri carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dianthus guliae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
