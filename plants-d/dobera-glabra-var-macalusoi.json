It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
