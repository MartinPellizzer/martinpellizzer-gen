    "intro": "Digitaria leiantha var. leucotricha, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Silverhair grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
