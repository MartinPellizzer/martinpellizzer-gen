    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers with a distinctive, slightly fragrant scent. The leaves are broad and fleshy, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It blooms from late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to gardens with its showy inflorescences."
