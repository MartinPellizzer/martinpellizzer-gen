    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudothelypteris, commonly known as the false bird's-nest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture."
