    "intro": "Dryopteris clypeata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive central vein. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The shield fern is known for its ability to spread through both sexual reproduction via spores and vegetative propagation through its rhizomes."
