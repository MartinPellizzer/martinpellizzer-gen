    "intro": "Davallia parkeri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
