    "intro": "Dendrobium connatum var. distachyon, commonly known as the orchid with the distinctive two-branched inflorescence, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
