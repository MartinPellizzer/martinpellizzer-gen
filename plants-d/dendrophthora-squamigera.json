    "intro": "Dendrophthora squamigera, commonly known as the scaly bark fungus, is a species of basidiomycete fungus that primarily inhabits decaying hardwoods. It is characterized by its distinctive scaly, reddish-brown bark-like appearance, which gives it its common name. This fungus is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on fallen or dead trees. Its fruiting bodies are often small and resemble lichens, making it challenging to identify without close examination. Dendrophthora squamigera plays a vital role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems."
