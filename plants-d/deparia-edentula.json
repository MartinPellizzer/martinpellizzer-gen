    "intro": "Deparia edentula, commonly known as the toothless fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Deparia edentula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
