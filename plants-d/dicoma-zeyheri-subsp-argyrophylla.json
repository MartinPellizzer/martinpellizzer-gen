    "intro": "Dicoma zeyheri subsp. argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf dicoma, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
