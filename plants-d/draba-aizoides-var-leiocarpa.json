    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind."
