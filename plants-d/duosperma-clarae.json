It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds.

Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
