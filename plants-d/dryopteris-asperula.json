    "intro": "Dryopteris asperula, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Dryopteris asperula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
