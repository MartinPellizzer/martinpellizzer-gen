    "intro": "Danthonia nana, commonly known as the dwarf danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
