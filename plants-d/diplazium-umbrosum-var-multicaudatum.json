    "intro": "Diplazium umbrosum var. multicaudatum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
