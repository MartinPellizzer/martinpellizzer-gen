    "intro": "Dicksonia eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique circinate vernation, where the young fronds spiral around the stem before unfurling. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and storing nutrients. Dicksonia eggersii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
