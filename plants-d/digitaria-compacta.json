    "intro": "Digitaria compacta, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Digitaria compacta is often used in landscaping and for erosion control because of its hardiness and ability to thrive with minimal water."
