    "intro": "Dryopteris trinidadensis, commonly known as the Trinidad fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant forms compact, bushy clusters and is well adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in moist, well-drained soils. This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
