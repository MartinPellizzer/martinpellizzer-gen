    "intro": "Diplazium franconis var. aspidiiforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall brake, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The fronds are typically semi-evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, broad shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
