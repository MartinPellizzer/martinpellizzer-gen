    "intro": "Daphne alpina, commonly known as the alpine daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, often fragrant, flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a distinctive waxy coating. Daphne alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
