    "intro": "Dorstenia aristeguietae, commonly known as the \"Mexican spider plant,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves that resemble a spider's legs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
