    "intro": "Dracophyllum patens, commonly known as the spreading dracophyllum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Dracophyllum patens is also known for its aromatic properties, with a distinctive scent that becomes more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
