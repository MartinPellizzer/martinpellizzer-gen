It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched. Draba bifurcata is known for its early blooming period, often appearing in late spring, and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season."
