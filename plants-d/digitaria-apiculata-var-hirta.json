    "intro": "Digitaria apiculata var. hirta, commonly known as hairy digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
