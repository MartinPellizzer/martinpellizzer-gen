    "intro": "Dithyridanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring small, pale flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dithyridanthus is considered endangered, making it a focus of conservation efforts."
