    "intro": "Danthonia crispa var. macrostachya, commonly known as the hairy broomgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
