It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compound leaves with oval, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, conical, woody pods. The seeds within the pods are encased in a hard, fibrous husk, which is a typical feature of the genus Didymocarpus. This species is often grown for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
