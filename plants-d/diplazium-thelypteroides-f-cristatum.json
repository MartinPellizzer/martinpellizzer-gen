    "intro": "Diplazium thelypteroides f. cristatum, commonly known as the cristate water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
