    "intro": "Dendrobium delacourii, commonly known as the Delacour's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom during the rainy season. Dendrobium delacourii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
