    "intro": "Dioscorea humilis subsp. polyanthes, commonly known as the Mexican yam or polyanthes yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source, though they require careful preparation to avoid toxicity. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
