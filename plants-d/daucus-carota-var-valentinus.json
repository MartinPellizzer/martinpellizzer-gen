    "intro": "Daucus carota var. valentinus, commonly known as the Valentine carrot, is a cultivated variant of the wild carrot. It is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers and a slender, often reddish root. This variety is typically grown for ornamental purposes rather than culinary use due to its delicate and less edible root. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden borders and rockeries. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to the landscape."
