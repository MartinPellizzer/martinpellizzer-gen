    "intro": "Dryopteris honolulensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian shield fern, is a unique species native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
