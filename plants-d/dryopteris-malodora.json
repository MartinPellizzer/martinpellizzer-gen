    "intro": "Dryopteris malodora, commonly known as the stinking wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its stout, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's common name refers to its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fronds are crushed."
