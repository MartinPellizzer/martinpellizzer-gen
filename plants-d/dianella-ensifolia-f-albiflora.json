    "intro": "Dianella ensifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered flax lily, is a rare and striking variant of the native New Zealand flax lily. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and birds. The white-flowered form is less common than the typical green-flowered variety, making it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
