    "intro": "Dendrobium flavispiculum, commonly known as the golden-spined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, cane-like stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium flavispiculum is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its vibrant, showy blooms."
