    "intro": "Deparia zanzibarica, commonly known as Zanzibar fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Zanzibar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
