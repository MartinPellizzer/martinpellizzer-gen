    "intro": "Dendrobium grantii, commonly known as the Grant's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it blooms with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a deep red or purple lip. Dendrobium grantii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
