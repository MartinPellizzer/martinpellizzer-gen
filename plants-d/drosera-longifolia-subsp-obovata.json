    "intro": "Drosera longifolia subsp. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet heathlands. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
