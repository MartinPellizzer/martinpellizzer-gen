    "intro": "Digitaria truncata, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Digitaria truncata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
