    "intro": "Dasycoleum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
