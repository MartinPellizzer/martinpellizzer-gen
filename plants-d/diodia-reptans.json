    "intro": "Diodia reptans, commonly known as creeping dottle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in traditional herbal practices. Diodia reptans is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
