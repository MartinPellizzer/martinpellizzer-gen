The plant's leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Diacrium bivalvatulum reproduces through a complex pollination process involving specific insect pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
