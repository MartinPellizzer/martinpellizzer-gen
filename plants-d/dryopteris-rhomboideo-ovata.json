    "intro": "Dryopteris rhomboideo-ovata, commonly known as the ovate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rhombic-ovate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. The ovate wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
