It features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium hymenopetalum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
