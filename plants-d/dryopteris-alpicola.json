    "intro": "Dryopteris alpicola, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris alpicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
