    "intro": "Drymophloeus hentyi, commonly known as the Henty's candlewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and cylindrical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
