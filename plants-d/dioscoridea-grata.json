    "intro": "Dioscoridea grata, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features a robust rhizome system that stores starch, which is the basis of its culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its starchy roots used in food and medicine."
