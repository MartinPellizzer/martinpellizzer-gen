    "intro": "Digitaria swazilandensis, commonly known as Swaziland grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Digitaria swazilandensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
