    "intro": "Dicksonia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged fronds that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value."
