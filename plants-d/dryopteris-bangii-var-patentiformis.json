    "intro": "Dryopteris bangii var. patentiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, and flat shape, with pinnae that are widely spaced and often curved. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
