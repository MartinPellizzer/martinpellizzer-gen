    "intro": "Dombeya leiomacrantha var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are typically clustered in terminal panicles and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
