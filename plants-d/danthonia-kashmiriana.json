It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
