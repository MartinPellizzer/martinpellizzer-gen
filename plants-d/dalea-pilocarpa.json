    "intro": "Dalea pilocarpa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Dalea pilocarpa is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
