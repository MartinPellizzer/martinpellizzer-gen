    "intro": "Dryopteris atrispora, commonly known as the black-spored wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green color and a serrated margin. The spores are black and are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. This fern is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
