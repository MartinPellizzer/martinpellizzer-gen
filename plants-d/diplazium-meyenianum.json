    "intro": "Diplazium meyenianum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Diplazium meyenianum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
