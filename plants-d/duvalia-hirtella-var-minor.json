It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, hairy stems and small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticulture."
