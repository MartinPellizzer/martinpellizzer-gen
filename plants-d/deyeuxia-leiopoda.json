It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems that often root at the base. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds.
