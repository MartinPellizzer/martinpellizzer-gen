    "intro": "Danthoniopsis tristachyoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muhly, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to saturated soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
