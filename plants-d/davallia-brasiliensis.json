    "intro": "Davallia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a fern characterized by its long, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, glossy pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients. Davallia brasiliensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
