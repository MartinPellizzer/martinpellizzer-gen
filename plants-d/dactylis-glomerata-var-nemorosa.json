It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrel, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds in dense, spike-like clusters. Dactylis glomerata var. nemorosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
