    "intro": "Dimerostemma goyazense, commonly known as the Goyazense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Spondias*, through its haustelia, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Due to habitat loss, Dimerostemma goyazense is considered endangered and is of particular interest in botanical and ecological studies."
