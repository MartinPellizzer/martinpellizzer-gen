    "intro": "Drosera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant ecology."
