    "intro": "Dracaena pendula, commonly known as the weeping dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cascading, arching foliage that gives it a distinctive, waterfall-like appearance. The plant features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with silver or white streaks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena pendula is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
