    "intro": "Dendrochilum bandaharaense, commonly known as the Bandahara orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
