The plant belongs to the genus Durio in the family Malvaceae, and it is closely related to the more familiar durian species. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The fruit's thick, fibrous pericarp contains a creamy, aromatic pulp that is highly prized in local markets."
