    "intro": "Deutzia scabra var. cymis-paucifloris, commonly known as the scaly deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-bark and small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in cymes. The plant has slender, arching branches and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun. This variety is less floriferous than other deutzia species, making it a subtle yet elegant addition to landscapes."
