    "intro": "Dryopteris rivularioides var. pseudomontana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
