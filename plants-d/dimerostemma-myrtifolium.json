    "intro": "Dimerostemma myrtifolium, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved dimerostemma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related genera. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of myrtle, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and produce a milky sap that is toxic to mammals. Dimerostemma myrtifolium is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
