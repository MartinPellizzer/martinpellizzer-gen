    "intro": "Didymopanax rugosus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant has compound leaves that are often deeply lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
