    "intro": "Duranta lorentzii, commonly known as the silver duranta, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
