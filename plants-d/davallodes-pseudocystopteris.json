It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive rhizome and produces delicate, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
