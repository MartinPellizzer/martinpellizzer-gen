    "intro": "Dorstenia poinsettiifolia var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed false poinsettia, is a member of the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the leaves of the poinsettia, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts. It is native to Mexico and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate."
