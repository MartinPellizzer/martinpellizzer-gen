    "intro": "Dipteracanthus confinis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser dipteracanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, which helps it blend with its surroundings. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
