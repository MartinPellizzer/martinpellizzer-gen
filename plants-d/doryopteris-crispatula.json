    "intro": "Doryopteris crispatula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like structure that adds to its ornamental value. Doryopteris crispatula plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
