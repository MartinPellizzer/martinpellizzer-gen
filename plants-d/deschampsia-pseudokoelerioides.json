    "intro": "Deschampsia pseudokoelerioides, commonly known as the New Zealand hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and coastal areas. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
