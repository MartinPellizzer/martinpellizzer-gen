    "intro": "Delphinium macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system consists of fibrous roots, and it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Delphinium macrocephalum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often used in cottage gardens and as a cut flower."
