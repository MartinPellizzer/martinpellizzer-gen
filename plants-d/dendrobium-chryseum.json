    "intro": "Dendrobium chryseum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its stems are typically wiry and can be somewhat branched, and it prefers warm, humid environments with good air circulation. Dendrobium chryseum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
