    "intro": "Dracosciadium, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in woodland or rocky habitats. Dracosciadium species are known for their medicinal properties, with some used in traditional herbal remedies. Its name is derived from the reddish color of its sap, which has historically been used as a dye and in tinctures."
