    "intro": "Doria bopinnata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
