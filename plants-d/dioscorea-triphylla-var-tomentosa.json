    "intro": "Dioscorea triphylla var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and unique foliage make it a distinctive species within the genus Dioscorea. The tubers are also occasionally used as a food source in some local cultures."
