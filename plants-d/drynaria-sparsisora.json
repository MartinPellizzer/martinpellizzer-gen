    "intro": "Drynaria sparsisora, commonly known as the sparse-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its natural habitat. The fronds are evergreen, and the plant can grow up to several meters in height."
