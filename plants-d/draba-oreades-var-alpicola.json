    "intro": "Draba oreades var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations. It has a compact growth form, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often a component of alpine flora communities."
