    "intro": "Diplocaulobium coplandii, commonly known as the Copland's diplocaulobium, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
