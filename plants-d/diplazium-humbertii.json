    "intro": "Diplazium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family."
