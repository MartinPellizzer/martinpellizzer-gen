    "intro": "Deyeuxia tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand wet conditions. Deyeuxia tweedyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
