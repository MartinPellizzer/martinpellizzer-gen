    "intro": "Dicerandra frutescens var. cornutissima, commonly known as the horned dicerandra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or scrubland environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
