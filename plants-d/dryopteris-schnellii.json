    "intro": "Dryopteris schnellii, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, silvery-white to light green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Dryopteris schnellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
