    "intro": "Drepananthus convocarii, commonly known as the call-to-me plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and swamps. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. The plant's common name reflects its tendency to thrive in areas where it is frequently disturbed or \"called\" to grow."
