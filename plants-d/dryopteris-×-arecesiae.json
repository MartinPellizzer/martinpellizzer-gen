    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 arecesiae, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant produces no spores, as it is a sterile hybrid, making it primarily ornamental in nature. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its botanical interest lies in its role as a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus."
