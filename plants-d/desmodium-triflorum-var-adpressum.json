    "intro": "Desmodium triflorum var. adpressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spherical heads, followed by hairy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock."
