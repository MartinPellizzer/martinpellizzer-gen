    "intro": "Dodonaea trigona, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Dodonaea trigona is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
