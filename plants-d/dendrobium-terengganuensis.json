    "intro": "Dendrobium terengganuensis, commonly known as the Terengganu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Malaysian state of Terengganu. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. It has lanceolate leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
