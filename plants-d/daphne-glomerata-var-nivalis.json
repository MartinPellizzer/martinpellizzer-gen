    "intro": "Daphne glomerata var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are glossy, dark green, and remain throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both winter and summer. This variety is particularly noted for its cold hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and delicate floral display."
