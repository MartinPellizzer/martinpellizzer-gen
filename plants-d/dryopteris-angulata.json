    "intro": "Dryopteris angulata, commonly known as the angular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and covered in a layer of brown, scaly tissue. The fronds are evergreen, remaining on the plant through winter, which adds to its ornamental value in gardens."
