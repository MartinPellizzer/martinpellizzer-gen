    "intro": "Dischidia collyris, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ability to climb, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
