It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in inflorescences. It is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Diplostephium revolutum plays a role in local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated."
