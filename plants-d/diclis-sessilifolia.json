    "intro": "Diclis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf diclis, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often clustered leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Diclis sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
