    "intro": "Dodonaea ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf hoppegrog, is a shrub native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, woody pods containing seeds. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Dodonaea ovata is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitats."
