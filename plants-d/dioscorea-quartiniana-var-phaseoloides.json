It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are similar in appearance to yams but are often used in traditional medicine and as a staple food in some regions. The species is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its potential for agricultural cultivation."
