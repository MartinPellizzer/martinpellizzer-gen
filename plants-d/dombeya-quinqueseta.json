    "intro": "Dombeya quinqueseta, commonly known as the five-leaved dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves composed of five lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dombeya quinqueseta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
