It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and coastal regions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
