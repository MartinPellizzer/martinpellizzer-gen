    "intro": "Drymaria stylosa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Drymaria stylosa is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
