    "intro": "Diasperus insulanus, commonly known as the island rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its island home. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Diasperus insulanus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity and providing food and shelter for various species."
