    "intro": "Danthonia depressa, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Danthonia depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
