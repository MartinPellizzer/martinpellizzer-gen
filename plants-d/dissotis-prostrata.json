It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Dissotis prostrata is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
