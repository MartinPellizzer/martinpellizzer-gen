    "intro": "Danthonia oreoboloides, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water conservation. Danthonia oreoboloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
