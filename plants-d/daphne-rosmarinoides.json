    "intro": "Daphne rosmarinoides, commonly known as sweet box, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, dark green, leathery leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces showy clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Daphne rosmarinoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
