    "intro": "Digitaria lanosa, commonly known as hairy digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which is often loosely arranged. Digitaria lanosa is often considered a weed but can serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
