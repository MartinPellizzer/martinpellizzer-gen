    "intro": "Delissea bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's delissea, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
