    "intro": "Dubrueilia peploides, commonly known as the velvetleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
