    "intro": "Dactylorchis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Dactylorchis umbrosa is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
