    "intro": "Dendrobium alabense, commonly known as the Alabang orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, wiry stems covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium alabense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
