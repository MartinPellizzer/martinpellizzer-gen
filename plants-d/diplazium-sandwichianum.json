    "intro": "Diplazium sandwichianum, commonly known as the Sandwich Island fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sorangia on the underside of its fronds. Diplazium sandwichianum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
