    "intro": "Discocactus heptacanthus subsp. melanochlorus, commonly known as the black-chlorine discocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dark, almost black, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
