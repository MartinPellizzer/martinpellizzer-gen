    "intro": "Dendrobium savannicola, commonly known as the savanna orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium savannicola thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
