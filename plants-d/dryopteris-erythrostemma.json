    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrostemma, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red stems that contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, producing spores on the underside. Dryopteris erythrostemma is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
