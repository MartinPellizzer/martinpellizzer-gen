    "intro": "Disphyma, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and compact growth form. Disphyma species often have a low-growing habit, with fleshy stems that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in inflorescences that are either racemose or cymose. Disphyma plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
