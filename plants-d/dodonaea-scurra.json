    "intro": "Dodonaea scurra, commonly known as silverleaf dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Dodonaea scurra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
