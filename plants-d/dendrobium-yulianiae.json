    "intro": "Dendrobium yulianiae, commonly known as the Yuliania orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. The orchid thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
