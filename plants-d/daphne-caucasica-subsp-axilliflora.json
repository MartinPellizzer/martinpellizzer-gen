It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered somewhat challenging to grow in colder climates."
