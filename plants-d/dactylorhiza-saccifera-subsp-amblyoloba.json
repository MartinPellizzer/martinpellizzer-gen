    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera subsp. amblyoloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaf lobes compared to other Dactylorhiza species."
