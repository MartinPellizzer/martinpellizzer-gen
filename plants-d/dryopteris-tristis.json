    "intro": "Dryopteris tristis, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a rusty or brownish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris tristis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
