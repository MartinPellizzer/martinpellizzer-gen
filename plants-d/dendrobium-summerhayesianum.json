It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium summerhayesianum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
