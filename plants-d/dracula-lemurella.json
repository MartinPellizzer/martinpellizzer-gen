    "intro": "Dracula lemurella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pale pink or white flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Dracula lemurella is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
