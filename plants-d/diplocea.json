    "intro": "Diplocea, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. They are often found in moist, grassy areas and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Diplocea species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate, dandelion-like appearance."
