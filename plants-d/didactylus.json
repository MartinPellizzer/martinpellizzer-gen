    "intro": "Didactylus, commonly known as the \"walking fern,\" is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure, often with four to eight leaflets. Didactylus species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. They have a unique ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, where new plants grow from the stems that touch the water surface. The genus is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
