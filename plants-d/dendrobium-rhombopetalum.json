    "intro": "Dendrobium rhombopetalum, commonly known as the rhombus-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive rhombus-shaped lip. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
