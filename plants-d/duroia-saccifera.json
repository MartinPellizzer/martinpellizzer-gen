    "intro": "Duroia saccifera, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its fruits take about 18 months to mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the nuts. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest and is economically significant for its valuable nut crop."
