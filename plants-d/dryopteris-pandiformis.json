    "intro": "Dryopteris pandiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically 40\u201380 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, and it thrives in acidic soils. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
