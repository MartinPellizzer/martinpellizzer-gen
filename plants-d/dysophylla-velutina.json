    "intro": "Dysophylla velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Dysophylla velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
