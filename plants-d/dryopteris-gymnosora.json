    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnosora, commonly known as the barren wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in its natural habitat."
