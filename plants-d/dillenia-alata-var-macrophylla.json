    "intro": "Dillenia alata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant dillenia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The leaves are typically smooth and have a waxy texture, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by distinctive, spiny bracts. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats in Southeast Asia. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
