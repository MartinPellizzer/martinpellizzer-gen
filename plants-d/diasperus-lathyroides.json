    "intro": "Diasperus lathyroides, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a stout, succulent stem that is often hairy and can grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical head, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Diasperus lathyroides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
