    "intro": "Disperis zeylanica var. neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri Disperis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Nilgiri Mountains in India. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
