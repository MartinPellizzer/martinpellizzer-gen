    "intro": "Didymocarpus sericeus, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The bark is smooth and greyish, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
