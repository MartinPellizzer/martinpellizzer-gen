    "intro": "Draba cinerea subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sandflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of Greenland and northern Scandinavia. It typically forms a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology and flowering time are closely tied to the short growing season of its native habitat."
