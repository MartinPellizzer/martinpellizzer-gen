    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. dubium, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
