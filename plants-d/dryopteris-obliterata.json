    "intro": "Dryopteris obliterata, commonly known as the barren woodsfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris obliterata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
