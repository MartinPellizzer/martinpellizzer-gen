    "intro": "Drosera pauciflora var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, low-growing species with a rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers in late winter to early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the rosette. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous habits, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare and unusual plants."
