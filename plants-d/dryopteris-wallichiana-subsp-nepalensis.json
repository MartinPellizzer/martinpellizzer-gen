    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in horticulture for its lush, feathery appearance."
