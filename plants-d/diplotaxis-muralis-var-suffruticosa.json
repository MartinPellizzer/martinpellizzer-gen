    "intro": "Diplotaxis muralis var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with greyish-green, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
