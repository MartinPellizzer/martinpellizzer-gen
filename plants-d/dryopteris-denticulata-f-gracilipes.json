    "intro": "Dryopteris denticulata f. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-crested wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of forming dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
