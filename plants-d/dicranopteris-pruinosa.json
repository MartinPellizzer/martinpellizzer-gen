    "intro": "Dicranopteris pruinosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. Dicranopteris pruinosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
