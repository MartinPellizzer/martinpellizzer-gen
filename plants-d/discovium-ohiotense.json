    "intro": "Discovium ohiotense, commonly known as the Ohio shield-fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
