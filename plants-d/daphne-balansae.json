    "intro": "Daphne balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Daphne, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
