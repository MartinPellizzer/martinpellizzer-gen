    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. pulchra, commonly known as the purple false oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features fine, silver-green blades with a distinctive purplish hue along the edges, especially in the inflorescence. Its flowering heads are slender, spike-like clusters that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
