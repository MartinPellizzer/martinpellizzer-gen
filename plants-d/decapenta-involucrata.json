    "intro": "Decapenta involucrata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
