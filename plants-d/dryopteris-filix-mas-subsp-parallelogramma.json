    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. parallelogramma, commonly known as the shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that often have a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
