    "intro": "Delphinium wentsaii, commonly known as the Wentsaii larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
