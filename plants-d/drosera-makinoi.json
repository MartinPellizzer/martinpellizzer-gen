    "intro": "Drosera makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are small and rosette-shaped, with a bright red coloration that helps attract prey. Drosera makinoi is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in cool, humid conditions."
