    "intro": "Dissotis segregata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to humid, aquatic environments."
