    "intro": "Dryopteris occidentalis, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months."
