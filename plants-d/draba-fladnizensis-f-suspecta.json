    "intro": "Draba fladnizensis f. suspecta, commonly known as the suspected fladnizen's rockcress, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its limited distribution suggests it may be a relict species or a result of hybridization with closely related Draba species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and ecological specialization."
