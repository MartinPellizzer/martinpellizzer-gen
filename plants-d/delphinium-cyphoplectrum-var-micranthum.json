    "intro": "Delphinium cyphoplectrum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for gardens with children or pets."
