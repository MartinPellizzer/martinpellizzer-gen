    "intro": "Dryoathyrium okuboanum, commonly known as the Okubo's dryoathyrium, is a rare and little-studied fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense canopies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
