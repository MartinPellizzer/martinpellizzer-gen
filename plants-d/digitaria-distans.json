    "intro": "Digitaria distans, commonly known as flatseeded lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Digitaria distans is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
