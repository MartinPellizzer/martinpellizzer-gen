    "intro": "Distichlis viridis, commonly known as green saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States and parts of Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species often found in dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
