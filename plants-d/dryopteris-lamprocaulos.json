    "intro": "Dryopteris lamprocaulos, commonly known as the silver-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with distinctive silver veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bipinnate, with a complex structure that enhances its ability to capture light for photosynthesis."
