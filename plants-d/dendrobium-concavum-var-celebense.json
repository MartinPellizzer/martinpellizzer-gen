    "intro": "Dendrobium concavum var. celebense, commonly known as the Celebes dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually fragrant, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and are borne on racemes. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivation."
