    "intro": "Descurainia pinnata f. simplex, commonly known as the simpleleaf tansy, is a variant of the tansy plant characterized by its simpler leaf structure compared to the typical form. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a reduced number of lobes, giving it a more streamlined appearance. This form is less commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its morphological variation."
