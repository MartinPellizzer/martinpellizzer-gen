    "intro": "Ditassa niruri, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forests where it relies on specific host species for survival."
