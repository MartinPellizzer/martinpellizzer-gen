It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and pond edges. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
