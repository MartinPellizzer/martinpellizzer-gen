It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces linear, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors ranging from white to pink and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
