    "intro": "Delphinium albocoeruleum, commonly known as the white-blue delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, blue to white flowers. The plant produces compound, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
