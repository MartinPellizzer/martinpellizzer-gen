    "intro": "Draba briquetii, commonly known as the Alpine draba, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 cm, with basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba briquetii is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to tolerate cold and harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
