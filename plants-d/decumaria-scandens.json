    "intro": "Decumaria scandens, commonly known as climbing brake, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that turn red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs and can climb by twining around supports. Decumaria scandens is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
