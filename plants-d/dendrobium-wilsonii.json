    "intro": "Dendrobium wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on trees or rocks. Its leaves are long and narrow, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium wilsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
