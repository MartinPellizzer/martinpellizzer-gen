    "intro": "Delphinium madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1o larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of many delphinium species. Delphinium madrense is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
