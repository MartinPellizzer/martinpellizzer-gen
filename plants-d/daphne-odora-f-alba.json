It is native to southern China and is prized for its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in winter or early spring. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
