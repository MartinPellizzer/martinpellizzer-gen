    "intro": "Dioscorea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some cultures. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy content, though they require careful preparation due to the presence of toxic compounds. Dioscorea pringlei is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
