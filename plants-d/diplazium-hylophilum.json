It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium hylophilum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Japan. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and on rocky slopes."
