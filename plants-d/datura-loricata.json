    "intro": "Datura loricata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and large, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, purple, and violet. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds. Datura loricata is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered invasive in some regions."
