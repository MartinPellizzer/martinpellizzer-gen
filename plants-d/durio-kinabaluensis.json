    "intro": "Durio kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu durian, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. This plant belongs to the Durian family, Dioscoreaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spiky fruit that resembles other durian varieties. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in montane rainforests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a short flowering period, making it a challenging species to study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Durio kinabaluensis is considered a conservation concern."
