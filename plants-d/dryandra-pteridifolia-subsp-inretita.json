    "intro": "Dryandra pteridifolia subsp. inretita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dryandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
