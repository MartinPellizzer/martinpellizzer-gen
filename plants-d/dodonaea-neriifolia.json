    "intro": "Dodonaea neriifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, bead-like fruits that are typically reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Dodonaea neriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
