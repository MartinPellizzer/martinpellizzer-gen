    "intro": "Desmodium galapagense, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its unique seed pods are covered in hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Desmodium galapagense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
