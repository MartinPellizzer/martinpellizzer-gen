    "intro": "Delima dasyphylla f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dasyphylla, is a variant of the dasyphylla plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in green or reddish bracts, and it produces small, round fruits. This succulent is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves."
