It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
