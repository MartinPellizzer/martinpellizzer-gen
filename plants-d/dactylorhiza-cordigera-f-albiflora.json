    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cordigera f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. This orchid thrives in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and peat bogs, where it forms dense clumps. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose spikes and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
