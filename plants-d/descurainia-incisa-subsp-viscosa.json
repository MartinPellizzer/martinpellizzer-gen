    "intro": "Descurainia incisa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
