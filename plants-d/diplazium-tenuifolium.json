    "intro": "Diplazium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, tree-like rhizome with a dense covering of aerial roots, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or other surfaces. The plant produces fiddlehead-like spore-bearing fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slightly curled appearance. Diplazium tenuifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
