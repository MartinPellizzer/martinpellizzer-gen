    "intro": "Draba cholaensis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-capsule rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds through a mechanism involving the splitting of the valve. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
