    "intro": "Deyeuxia scotica, commonly known as Scottish moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the British Isles. It is typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils of heathlands and moorlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia scotica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitat."
