    "intro": "Drimycarpus racemosus, commonly known as the African mountainbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are borne on slender branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
