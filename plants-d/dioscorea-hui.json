    "intro": "Dioscorea hui, commonly known as Chinese yam, is a perennial vine native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value."
