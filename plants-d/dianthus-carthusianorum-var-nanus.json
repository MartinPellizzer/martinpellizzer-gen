It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to form attractive mats over time."
