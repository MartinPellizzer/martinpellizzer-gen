    "intro": "Diplusodon glaziovii f. subspathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed diplusodon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structures. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with lanceolate, pubescent leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and have a subtle fragrance, contributing to its ecological significance in local pollination networks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
