    "intro": "Dipyrena arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa dipyrena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like structures, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
