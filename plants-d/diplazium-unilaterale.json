    "intro": "Diplazium unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided staghorn fern, is a species of polypodioid fern characterized by its unique frond structure. It features a distinctive, asymmetrical frond with a broad, shield-shaped base and a narrow, elongated upper portion. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to bark or other surfaces. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fuzzy spore-producing structures called sori. Diplazium unilaterale is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
