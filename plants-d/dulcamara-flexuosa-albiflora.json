    "intro": "Dulcamara flexuosa albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bittersweet, is a climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its twining stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along woodland edges or in hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it requires careful management."
