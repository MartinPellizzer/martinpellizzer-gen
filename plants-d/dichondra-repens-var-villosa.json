    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. villosa, commonly known as hairy prostrate dichondra, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial groundcover native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its dense, attractive foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to spread rapidly and form a dense carpet, making it ideal for erosion control and ground cover in shaded or partially sunny areas."
