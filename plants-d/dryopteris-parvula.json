    "intro": "Dryopteris parvula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to form dense, low-growing clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris parvula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
