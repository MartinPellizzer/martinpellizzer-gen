    "intro": "Dendrobium sociale, commonly known as the social orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium sociale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
