    "intro": "Drosera intermedia f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or marshy environments, where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological role."
