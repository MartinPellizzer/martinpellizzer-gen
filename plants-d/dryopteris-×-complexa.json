    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complexa, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often a deep green, with some varieties displaying variegated patterns. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in natural and cultivated settings."
