    "intro": "Delphinium acutilobum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, sharp appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
