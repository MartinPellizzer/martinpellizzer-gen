    "intro": "Dryopteris parksii, commonly known as the Park's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Dryopteris parksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
