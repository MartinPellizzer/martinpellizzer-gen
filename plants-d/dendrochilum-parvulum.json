    "intro": "Dendrochilum parvulum, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Dendrochilum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
