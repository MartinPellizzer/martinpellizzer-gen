    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 stenostachys nothosubsp. stenkyrkae, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tall spikes of fragrant, violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin and its role in the study of orchid taxonomy and evolution."
