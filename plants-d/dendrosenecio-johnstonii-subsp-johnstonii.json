    "intro": "Dendrosenecio johnstonii subsp. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's tree heath, is a succulent shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
