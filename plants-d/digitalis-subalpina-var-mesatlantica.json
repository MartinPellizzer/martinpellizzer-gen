    "intro": "Digitalis subalpina var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Alpine foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. The plant produces striking tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, which attract pollinators such as bumblebees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
