    "intro": "Dicranopygium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has diminutive leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Dicranopygium microcephalum is an ancient lineage of plants, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relic species that provides insight into the evolution of early land plants."
