    "intro": "Dentaria \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the hybrid toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
