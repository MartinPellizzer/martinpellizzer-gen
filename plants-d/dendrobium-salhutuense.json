    "intro": "Dendrobium salhutuense, commonly known as the Salhutu orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Tanzania. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dendrobium salhutuense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
