    "intro": "Dianthus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with a distinctive, frilly appearance, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Dianthus alpestris thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine environments."
