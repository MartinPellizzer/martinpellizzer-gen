    "intro": "Draba soratensis, commonly known as the Soratensian whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Draba soratensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
