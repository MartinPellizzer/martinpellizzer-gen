    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 aschersoniana nothosubsp. ishorica, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. This subspecies is native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of resupinate flowers. The plant exhibits a complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Dactylorhiza lapponica and Dactylorhiza maculata."
