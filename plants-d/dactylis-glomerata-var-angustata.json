    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate moderate grazing and drought conditions."
