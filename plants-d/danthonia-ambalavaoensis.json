    "intro": "Danthonia ambalavaoensis, commonly known as the Ambalavao grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
