    "intro": "Drosera gracilis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms during the cooler months. Drosera gracilis is a low-growing plant that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
