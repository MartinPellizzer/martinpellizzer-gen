    "intro": "Draba verna subsp. praecox, commonly known as early whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate and bright green, while its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a loose cluster. It blooms early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. This species is part of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open at maturity."
