    "intro": "Diplopeltis stuartii var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular diplopeltis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, warm climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
