    "intro": "Drypetes longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and reforestation projects."
