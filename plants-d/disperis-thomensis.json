    "intro": "Disperis thomensis, commonly known as the Tomine mountain orchid, is a strikingly beautiful orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mozambique. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers have a distinct, intricate structure with three sepals and three petals, and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
