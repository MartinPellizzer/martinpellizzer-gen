    "intro": "Davilla undulata, commonly known as the zigzag beauty or Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Davilla undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
