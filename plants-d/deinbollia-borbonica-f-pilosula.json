    "intro": "Deinbollia borbonica f. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy leafed variant of the genus Deinbollia, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of capsule fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
