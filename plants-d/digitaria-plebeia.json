    "intro": "Digitaria plebeia, commonly known as little fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. Digitaria plebeia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
