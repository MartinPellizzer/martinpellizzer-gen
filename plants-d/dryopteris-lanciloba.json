    "intro": "Dryopteris lanciloba, commonly known as the long-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The long-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
