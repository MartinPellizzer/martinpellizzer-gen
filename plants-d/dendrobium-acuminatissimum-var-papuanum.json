It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent, tooth-like lobes on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its unique floral morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
