    "intro": "Deguelia chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf deguelia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often arranged in a pinnate pattern. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in panicles, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Deguelia chrysophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
