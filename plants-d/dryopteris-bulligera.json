    "intro": "Dryopteris bulligera, commonly known as the bull's ear fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Dryopteris bulligera is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
