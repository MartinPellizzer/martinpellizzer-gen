It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. The plant is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
