It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Danthonia rangei produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment."
