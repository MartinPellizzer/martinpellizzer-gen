    "intro": "Davallia pusilla, commonly known as the mouse's tail fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, leathery fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden settings."
