    "intro": "Duranta plumieri var. normalis, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in the summer months. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
