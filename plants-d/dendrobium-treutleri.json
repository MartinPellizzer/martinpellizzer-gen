    "intro": "Dendrobium treutleri, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found on trees or rocks. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers with a fragrant scent, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium treutleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
