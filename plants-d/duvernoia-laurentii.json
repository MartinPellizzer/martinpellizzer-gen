    "intro": "Duvernoia laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentii's duvernoia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
