    "intro": "Dimorphorchis tenomensis, commonly known as the Teneriffe orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically feature a deep violet or purple coloration with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other substrates in its natural habitat. Its morphology includes a slender stem with a few leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dimorphorchis tenomensis is considered a conservation concern."
