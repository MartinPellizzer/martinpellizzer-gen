It belongs to the family Aroidae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a single large flower. The plant produces a spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the smaller, clustered spathulate flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Dortmanna madagascariensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
