    "intro": "Daphniphyllum teysmannii var. iriomotense, commonly known as the Iriomote holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a striking feature of the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
