It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds producing spores on the underside. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
