    "intro": "Diphasium zanclophyllum, commonly known as the Zanclophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-phase growth pattern, which involves a transition from a juvenile to a mature form. The plant features elongated, spiral-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and specialized ecological requirements, Diphasium zanclophyllum is considered a vulnerable species."
