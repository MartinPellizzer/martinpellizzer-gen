    "intro": "Dendrobium nutantiflorum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive growth habit with pendulous stems that often droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a prominent lip, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium nutantiflorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
