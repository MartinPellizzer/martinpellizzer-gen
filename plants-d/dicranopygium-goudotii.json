It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, grass-like leaves that are often curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores when mature. Dicranopygium goudotii plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
