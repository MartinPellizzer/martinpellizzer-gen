    "intro": "Delphinium gyalanum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. Delphinium gyalanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
