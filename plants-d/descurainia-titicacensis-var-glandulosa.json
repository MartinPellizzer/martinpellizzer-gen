    "intro": "Descurainia titicacensis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Andean tansy, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in tiny glands that secrete substances, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced glandularity compared to other forms of Descurainia titicacensis."
