    "intro": "Dendrobium cymbidioides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that are often covered in a thick, leathery layer. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium cymbidioides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
