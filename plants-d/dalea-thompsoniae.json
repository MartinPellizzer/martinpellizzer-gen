    "intro": "Dalea thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Dalea thompsoniae is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
