    "intro": "Diclidium uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in temperate regions. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft, muddy substrates, while its leaves are submerged or floating. Diclidium uliginosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
