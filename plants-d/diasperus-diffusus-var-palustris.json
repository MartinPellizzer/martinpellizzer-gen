    "intro": "Diasperus diffusus var. palustris, commonly known as the swampy spreader, is a variant of the Diasperus diffusus species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
