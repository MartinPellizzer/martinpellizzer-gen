    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudorarum, commonly known as the rare pseudorarum orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems that are covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
