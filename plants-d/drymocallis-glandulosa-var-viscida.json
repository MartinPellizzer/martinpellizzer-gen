    "intro": "Drymocallis glandulosa var. viscida, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
