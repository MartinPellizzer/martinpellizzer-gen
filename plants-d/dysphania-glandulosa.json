    "intro": "Dysphania glandulosa, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Dysphania glandulosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
