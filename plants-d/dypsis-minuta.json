    "intro": "Dypsis minuta, commonly known as the miniature areca palm, is a small, elegant palm native to Madagascar. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface. The plant produces feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Dypsis minuta is prized for its compact size and ornamental appeal in both tropical and temperate climates."
