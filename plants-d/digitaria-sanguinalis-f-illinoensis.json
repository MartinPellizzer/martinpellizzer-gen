    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis f. illinoensis, commonly known as Illinois grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained habitats. This grass is often found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range."
