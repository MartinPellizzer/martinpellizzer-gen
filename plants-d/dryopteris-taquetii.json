    "intro": "Dryopteris taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
