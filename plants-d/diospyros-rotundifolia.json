    "intro": "Diospyros rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are round or broadly ovate in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange to reddish fruits. Its fruits are typically eaten fresh or used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
