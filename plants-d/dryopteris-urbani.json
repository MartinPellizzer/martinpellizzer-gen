    "intro": "Dryopteris urbani, commonly known as the urban fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris urbani is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
