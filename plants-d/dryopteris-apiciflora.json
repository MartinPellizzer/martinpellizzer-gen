    "intro": "Dryopteris apiciflora, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sporangia. The fringed wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
