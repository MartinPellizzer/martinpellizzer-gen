    "intro": "Dryopteris tetragona var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costarica wood fern, is a fern species native to Central America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is notable for its adaptability to humid tropical climates and its role in local ecosystems."
