    "intro": "Digitaria diagonalis var. robustius, commonly known as broadleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with wide, flat leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
