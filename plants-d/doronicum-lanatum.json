    "intro": "Doronicum lanatum, commonly known as the downy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a soft, downy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
