    "intro": "Delphinium pellucidum, commonly known as the clearleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy appearance, giving it the \"pellucidum\" designation. Delphinium pellucidum is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
