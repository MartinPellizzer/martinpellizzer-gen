    "intro": "Dendrobium putnamii, commonly known as the Putnam's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, often branched stems that bear dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium putnamii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
