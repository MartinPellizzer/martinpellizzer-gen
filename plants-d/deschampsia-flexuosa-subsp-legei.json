    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa subsp. legei, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats. Its adaptability makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for erosion control."
