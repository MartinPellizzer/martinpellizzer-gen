    "intro": "Dipterygia capitata, commonly known as the yellow mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Dipterygia capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
