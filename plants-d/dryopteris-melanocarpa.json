    "intro": "Dryopteris melanocarpa, commonly known as the black wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features a tall, upright rhizome with a dark, almost black stem, which gives it its common name. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that turns bronze in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its distinctive appearance."
