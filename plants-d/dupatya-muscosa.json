    "intro": "Dupatya muscosa, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dupatya muscosa plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its natural habitat."
