    "intro": "Dryopteris hallieri, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that create a feathery, elegant look."
