    "intro": "Diuris punctata f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower spike. The flowers are typically yellow or sulphur-yellow, with a distinctive, intricate pattern that resembles a spider's web. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the species, distinguished by its more intense coloration and floral structure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected and requires careful conservation efforts."
