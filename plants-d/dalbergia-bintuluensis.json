    "intro": "Dalbergia bintuluensis, commonly known as Bintulu rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Borneo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. It is valued for its high-quality timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
