    "intro": "Drosera peruensis, commonly known as the Peruvian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, and it blooms during the cooler months. Drosera peruensis is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in controlling insect populations."
