    "intro": "Deinbollia laurentii var. cuspidata, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The species is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
