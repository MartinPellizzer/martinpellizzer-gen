    "intro": "Drynaria glauca, commonly known as the blue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that have a distinctive blue-gray hue on the underside. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, showing a preference for tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Drynaria glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
