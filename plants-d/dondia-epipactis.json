    "intro": "Dondia epipactis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Dondia epipactis is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its specialized root system and intricate flower structure."
