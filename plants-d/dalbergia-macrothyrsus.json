    "intro": "Dalbergia macrothyrsus, commonly known as African rosewood, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a distinctive rose-like scent when cut. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
