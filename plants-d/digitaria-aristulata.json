    "intro": "Digitaria aristulata, commonly known as the slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Digitaria aristulata is often found in dry to mesic environments and is adapted to tolerate various soil conditions."
