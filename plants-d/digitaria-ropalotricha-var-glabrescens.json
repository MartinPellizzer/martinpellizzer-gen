    "intro": "Digitaria ropalotricha var. glabrescens, commonly known as silky grass or silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
