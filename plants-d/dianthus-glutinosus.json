    "intro": "Dianthus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky pink or sticky carnation, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers with a distinctive sticky substance on the petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or wildflower displays. Dianthus glutinosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
