    "intro": "Dendrobium beamanianum, commonly known as the Beaman's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
