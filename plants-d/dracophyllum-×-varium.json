    "intro": "Dracophyllum \u00d7 varium, commonly known as the hybrid snow heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are leathery and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Dracophyllum \u00d7 varium is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh maritime conditions."
