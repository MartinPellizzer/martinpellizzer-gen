It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in moist, shaded habitats. Its unique floral structure includes both regular and irregularly shaped petals, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
