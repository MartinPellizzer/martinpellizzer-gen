It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Dichrotrichum ternateum is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges."
