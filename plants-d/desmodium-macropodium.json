    "intro": "Desmodium macropodium, commonly known as the large-leaf desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a prominent, heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Desmodium macropodium is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
