    "intro": "Dendrobium milaniae, commonly known as the Milania's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are arranged in clusters along the stems. Dendrobium milaniae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
