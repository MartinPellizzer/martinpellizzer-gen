    "intro": "Desmodium gardneri, commonly known as the Florida burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Desmodium gardneri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
