    "intro": "Diplazium smithianum, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to bark or other surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium smithianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in humid environments."
