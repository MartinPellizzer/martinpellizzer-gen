    "intro": "Dudleya virens, commonly known as the liveforever plant, is a succulent species native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to violet, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Dudleya virens is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
