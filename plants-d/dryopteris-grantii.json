    "intro": "Dryopteris grantii, commonly known as the Grant's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris grantii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
