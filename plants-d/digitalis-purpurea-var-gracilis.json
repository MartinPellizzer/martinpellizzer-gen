    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, slender stems that bear tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink, typical of the Digitalis genus. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive spurred petal at the back, aiding in pollination by insects. The plant produces a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a velvety texture. It thrives in woodland or shady garden settings, preferring moist, well-drained soil."
