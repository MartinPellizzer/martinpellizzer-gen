    "intro": "Dicliptera skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's dicliptera, is a perennial herb native to Central America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Dicliptera skutchii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
