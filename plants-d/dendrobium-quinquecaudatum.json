    "intro": "Dendrobium quinquecaudatum, commonly known as the five-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium quinquecaudatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
