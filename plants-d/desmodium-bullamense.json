It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, curved pods that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Desmodium bullamense is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
