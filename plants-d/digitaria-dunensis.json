    "intro": "Digitaria dunensis, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Digitaria dunensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
