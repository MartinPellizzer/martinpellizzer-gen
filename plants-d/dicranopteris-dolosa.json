    "intro": "Dicranopteris dolosa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, lobed segments, which aid in photosynthesis and buoyancy. Dicranopteris dolosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
