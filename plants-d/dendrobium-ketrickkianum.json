    "intro": "Dendrobium ketrickkianum, commonly known as the Ketrick's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium ketrickkianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
