    "intro": "Dyckia racinae, commonly known as the Cape York Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and ecological significance in its native habitat."
