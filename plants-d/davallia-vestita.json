    "intro": "Davallia vestita, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
