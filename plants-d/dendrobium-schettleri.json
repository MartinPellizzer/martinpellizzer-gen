    "intro": "Dendrobium schettleri, commonly known as the Schettler's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium schettleri is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
