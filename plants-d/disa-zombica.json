    "intro": "Disa zombica, commonly known as the zombie orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vivid purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its unique, elongated petals that resemble fingers, giving it an otherworldly appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Despite its eerie common name, it is a beautiful and fascinating addition to any botanical garden."
