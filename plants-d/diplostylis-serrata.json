    "intro": "Diplostylis serrata, commonly known as the serrated diplostylis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
