    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. arduennensis, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers with distinctive markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip."
