    "intro": "Dendrocolla emarginata, commonly known as the marginate dendrocolla, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy, spurred orchid-like flower. The plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in tropical regions. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dendrocolla emarginata is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species."
