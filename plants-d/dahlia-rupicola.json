    "intro": "Dahlia rupicola, commonly known as the rock dahlia, is a perennial plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils, adapting well to arid environments. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of drought. The foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss."
