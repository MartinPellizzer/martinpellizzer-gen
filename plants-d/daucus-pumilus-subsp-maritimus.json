    "intro": "Daucus pumilus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. The plant has small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a cylindrical, ridged structure that resembles a tiny carrot, giving it its common name. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to maritime environments."
