    "intro": "Dipterocarpus verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick, and often rough-textured leaves, which are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
