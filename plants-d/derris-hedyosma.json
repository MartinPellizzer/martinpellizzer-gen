    "intro": "Derris hedyosma, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its root system is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used in pest control. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
