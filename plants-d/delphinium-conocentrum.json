    "intro": "[WRONG START] Delphinium conocentum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
