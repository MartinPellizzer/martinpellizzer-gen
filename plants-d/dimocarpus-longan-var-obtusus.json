    "intro": "Dimocarpus longan var. obtusus, commonly known as the blunt-leaf longan, is a variant of the longan tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, obtuse leaves that are slightly smaller than those of the standard longan. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, sweet, and juicy fruits. The fruit has a white, fibrous pulp surrounding a single, inedible seed. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
