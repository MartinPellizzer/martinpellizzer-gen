    "intro": "Dichapetalum sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf dichapetalum, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive leaves rather than its flowers."
