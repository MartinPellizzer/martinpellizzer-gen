    "intro": "Daemonorops, commonly known as the cycads, are ancient flowering plants belonging to the family Cycadaceae. They are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. Daemonorops species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants, and they produce cones rather than flowers. Due to their slow growth and ecological importance, many Daemonorops species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
