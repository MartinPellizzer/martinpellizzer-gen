    "intro": "Dryopteris amplissima var. phaeochlamys, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the broad female fern characterized by its distinctive golden-brown fronds. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland areas. The fronds are large, with a leathery texture and a broad, shield-like shape, giving it its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
