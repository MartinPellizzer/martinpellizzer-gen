    "intro": "Daphne bholua var. glacialis, commonly known as the Himalayan daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the cold mountain regions of Nepal and India. It features dense, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, preferring cool, moist conditions. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with a sheltered location to protect it from harsh winter winds."
