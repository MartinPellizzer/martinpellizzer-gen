    "intro": "Dicksonia ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique, segmented trunk that is covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments."
