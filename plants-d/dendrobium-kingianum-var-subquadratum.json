    "intro": "Dendrobium kingianum var. subquadratum, commonly known as the King's Dendrobium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers with distinctive red veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
