    "intro": "Dryopteris asterothrix var. bibrachiata, commonly known as the two-branched wood fern, is a variant of the asterothrix wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a bipinnate structure with two branches, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
