    "intro": "Dendrobium trichosepalum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous horizontal pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium trichosepalum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
