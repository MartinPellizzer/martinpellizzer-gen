    "intro": "Didesmus panduriformis, commonly known as the panduriform pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in culinary and aromatic applications. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, tropical environments. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its versatile uses in traditional medicine and cooking."
