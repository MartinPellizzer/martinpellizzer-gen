    "intro": "Dendrobium guerreroi, commonly known as the Guerrero orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. Dendrobium guerreroi thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
