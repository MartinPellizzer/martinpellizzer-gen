    "intro": "Daucus fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically small and not as economically valuable as those of cultivated carrots. Daucus fontanesii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
