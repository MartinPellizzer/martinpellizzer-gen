    "intro": "Distichorchis dissitifolia, commonly known as the scattered-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its two-ranked leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid morphology with a single flower spike."
