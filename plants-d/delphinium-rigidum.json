    "intro": "Delphinium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium rigidum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
