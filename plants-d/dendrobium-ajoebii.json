    "intro": "Dendrobium ajoebii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its stems are typically erect and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Dendrobium ajoebii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
