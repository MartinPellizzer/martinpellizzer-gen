    "intro": "Diplazium sandwichense, commonly known as the Sandwich Island water fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
