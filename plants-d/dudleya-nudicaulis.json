    "intro": "Dudleya nudicaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf liveforever, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
