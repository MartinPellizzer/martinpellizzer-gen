    "intro": "Desmodium microphyllum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface, and its flowers are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
