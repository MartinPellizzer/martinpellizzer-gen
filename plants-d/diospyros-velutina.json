    "intro": "Diospyros velutina, commonly known as the velvet ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ebenaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red when mature, containing a single hard seed. Diospyros velutina is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of timber."
