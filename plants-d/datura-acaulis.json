    "intro": "Datura acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless stems and large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Datura acaulis is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Its growth habit is typically erect, with leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape."
