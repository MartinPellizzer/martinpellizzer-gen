It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Dugezia glandulosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
