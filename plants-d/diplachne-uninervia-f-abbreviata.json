    "intro": "Diplachne uninervia f. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf flatgrass, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, flat leaves. It is native to parts of Australia and is often found in grassy habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils. The plant has reduced leaf blades compared to the typical form, giving it a more condensed appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. This variant is adapted to thrive in drier conditions and is often used in low-maintenance landscaping."
