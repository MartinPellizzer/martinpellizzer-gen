    "intro": "Dendrobium hamatum, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender spikes of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium hamatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
