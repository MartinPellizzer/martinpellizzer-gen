It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are typically clustered in groups. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature.
