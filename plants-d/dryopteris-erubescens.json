    "intro": "Dryopteris erubescens, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright red young fronds that gradually turn green as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Dryopteris erubescens is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
