    "intro": "Delphinium longiciliatum, commonly known as the long-bearded larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue underside, and its flowers have five petals with prominent, spurred tips. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Delphinium longiciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids."
