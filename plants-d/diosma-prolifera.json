    "intro": "Diosma prolifera, commonly known as the creeping diosma, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Diosma prolifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
