It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, linear leaflets and produces small, yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils or as a weed in agricultural fields. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
