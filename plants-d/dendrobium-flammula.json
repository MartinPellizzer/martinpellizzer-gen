    "intro": "Dendrobium flammula, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the summer months. Its stems are often branched and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Dendrobium flammula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
