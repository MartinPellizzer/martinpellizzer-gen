    "intro": "Delphinium ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
