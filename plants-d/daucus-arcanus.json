    "intro": "Daucus arcanus, commonly known as the ghost fennel, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other fennel species. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, Daucus arcanus is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
