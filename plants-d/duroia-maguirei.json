    "intro": "Duroia maguirei, commonly known as the Guiana Shield arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. The plant's rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within its native habitat."
