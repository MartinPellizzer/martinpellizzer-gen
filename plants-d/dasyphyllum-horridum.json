    "intro": "Dasyphyllum horridum, commonly known as the rough dasyphyllum, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dasyphyllum horridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
