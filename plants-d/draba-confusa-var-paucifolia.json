    "intro": "Draba confusa var. paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species."
