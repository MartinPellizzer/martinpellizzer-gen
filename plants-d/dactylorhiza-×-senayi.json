    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 senayi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza lapponica. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs. It produces a tall, erect stem with a dense cluster of pale blue or white flowers. The roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, a common adaptation in orchids."
