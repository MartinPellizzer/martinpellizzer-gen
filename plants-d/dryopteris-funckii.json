    "intro": "Dryopteris funckii, commonly known as the Funck's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Dryopteris funckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
