It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and consists of several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Didymodoxa species are usually shrubs or subshrubs with lance-shaped leaves and a tendency to produce clusters of flowers. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for gardens and landscapes."
