    "intro": "Drimia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf African lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
