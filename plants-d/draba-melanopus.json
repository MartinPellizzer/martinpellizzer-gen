    "intro": "Draba melanopus, commonly known as the blackfooted wintergreen, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing bright yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Draba melanopus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
