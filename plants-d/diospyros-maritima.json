    "intro": "Diospyros maritima, commonly known as the sea ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, dark purple to black fruits that are edible when ripe. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in mangrove or coastal forest ecosystems. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing resistance to saltwater and erosion. Diospyros maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and supporting local wildlife."
