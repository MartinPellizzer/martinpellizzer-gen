    "intro": "Dichanthelium thermale subsp. thermale, commonly known as the thermal dichanthelium, is a grass species native to warm, moist habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically found in open, disturbed areas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
