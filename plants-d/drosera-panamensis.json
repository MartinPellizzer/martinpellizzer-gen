    "intro": "Drosera panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are covered in tiny, red-tipped tentacles that secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. Drosera panamensis is a perennial species that thrives in humid climates with ample sunlight."
