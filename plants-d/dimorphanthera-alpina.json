    "intro": "Dimorphanthera alpina, commonly known as the alpine dimorphanthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically features opposite leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. Dimorphanthera alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
