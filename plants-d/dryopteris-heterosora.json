    "intro": "Dryopteris heterosora, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
