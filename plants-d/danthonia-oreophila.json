    "intro": "Danthonia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Danthonia oreophila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
