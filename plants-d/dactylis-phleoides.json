    "intro": "Dactylis phleoides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Dactylis phleoides is valued for its hardiness and is used in forage and erosion control."
