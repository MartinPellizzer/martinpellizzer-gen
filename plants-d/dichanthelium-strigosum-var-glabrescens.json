    "intro": "Dichanthelium strigosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a panicled arrangement of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by minute, dry seeds. This variety is characterized by its reduced hairiness compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
