It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Diplodium brevichilum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
