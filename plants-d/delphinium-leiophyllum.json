    "intro": "Delphinium leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and pets."
