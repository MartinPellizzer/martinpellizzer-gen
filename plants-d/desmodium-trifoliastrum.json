It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its trifoliate structure and flowering pattern are key botanical features. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
