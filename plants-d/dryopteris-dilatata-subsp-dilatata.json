    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive, feathery appearance."
