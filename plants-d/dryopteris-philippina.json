    "intro": "Dryopteris philippina, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it can absorb nutrients from the water. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of new growth. The spores are released into the air, allowing the fern to reproduce and colonize new areas."
