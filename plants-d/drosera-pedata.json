    "intro": "Drosera pedata, commonly known as the Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red. Drosera pedata is a hardy species that can thrive in a variety of moist, sunny conditions."
