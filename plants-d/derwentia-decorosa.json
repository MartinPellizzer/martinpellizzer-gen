    "intro": "Derwentia decorosa, commonly known as the beautiful waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble a waterwheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in streams and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Derwentia decorosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
