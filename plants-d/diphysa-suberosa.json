    "intro": "Diphysa suberosa, commonly known as the silky diphysa, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, soft, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. Diphysa suberosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
