    "intro": "Dryopteris lanceola, commonly known as the lanceleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a dense covering of brownish-red hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective shield called a indusium. Dryopteris lanceola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, feathery appearance."
