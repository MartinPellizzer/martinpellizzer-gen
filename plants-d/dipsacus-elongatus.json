    "intro": "Dipsacus elongatus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique bracts, which resemble a crown, are used in traditional herbal medicine and as a fiber source. Dipsacus elongatus thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
