    "intro": "Doodia duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved basket fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
