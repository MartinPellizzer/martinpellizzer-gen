    "intro": "Dolicholus texanus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dolicholus, is a variant of the dolicholus plant native to specific regions of Texas. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
