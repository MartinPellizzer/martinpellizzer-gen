    "intro": "Diaphananthe pachyrhiza, commonly known as the broadroot daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, thickened roots and showy daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually basal, broad, and succulent, which helps it store water. The flowers are yellow with purple markings and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
