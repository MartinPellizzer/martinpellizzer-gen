    "intro": "Dalbergia ovata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
