    "intro": "Dictyocarpus, commonly known as the fan-leaf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, upright rosette. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being more prominent and often hanging downward. Its botanical features include a stout, unbranched stem and a thick, fibrous root system. Dictyocarpus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also of interest in botanical research due to their ancient lineage."
