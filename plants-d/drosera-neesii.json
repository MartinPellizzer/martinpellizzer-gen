    "intro": "Drosera neesii, commonly known as the Nees's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it is often found in coastal areas. Drosera neesii is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
