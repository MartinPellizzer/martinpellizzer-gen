    "intro": "Dryopteris minimisora, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover in shaded areas. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, contributing to its ability to spread slowly over time. The fronds are covered in tiny, scale-like structures that give the plant its characteristic appearance."
