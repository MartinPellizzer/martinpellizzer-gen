    "intro": "Diastema, commonly known as the \"gap tooth,\" is a botanical term referring to the natural space between two teeth. While not a plant, the term is sometimes used in botany to describe similar gaps between structures in plants, such as leaves or stems. In some species, diastema can occur due to differences in growth rates or developmental patterns. These gaps may serve functional roles, such as facilitating air flow or light penetration. The presence of diastema can also be an indicator of genetic or environmental influences on plant morphology."
