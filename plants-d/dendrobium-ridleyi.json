    "intro": "Dendrobium ridleyi, commonly known as the ridley's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its pseudobulbs forming clusters that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, appearing in clusters during the wet season. Dendrobium ridleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
