    "intro": "Deprea purpureocarpa, commonly known as the purple-fruited snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, purple berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
