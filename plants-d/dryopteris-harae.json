    "intro": "Dryopteris harae, commonly known as the Harae wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
