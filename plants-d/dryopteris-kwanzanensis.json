    "intro": "Dryopteris kwanzanensis, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It features a compact growth habit with deeply divided, glossy, dark green fronds that have a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and can tolerate a range of soil types once established."
