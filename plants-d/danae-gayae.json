    "intro": "Danae gayae, commonly known as the golden torch or flame plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its vibrant, fiery orange to red bracts that resemble flames. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are less showy than the bracts. Danae gayae thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
