    "intro": "Dendrobium calcaratum subsp. calcaratum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates, making it well-suited for climbing or epiphytic growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
