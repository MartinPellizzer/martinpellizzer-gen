    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum var. thermale, commonly known as the hot spring dichanthelium, is a variant of the grass species native to warmer, more arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its adaptability to high temperatures and low moisture makes it a resilient species in its native range."
