    "intro": "Daphniphyllum macropodum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved daphniphyllum, is a rare and unique evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for specialized gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
