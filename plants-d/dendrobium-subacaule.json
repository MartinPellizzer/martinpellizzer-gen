    "intro": "Dendrobium subacaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its stems are short and thick, often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Dendrobium subacaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both horticultural and medicinal purposes."
