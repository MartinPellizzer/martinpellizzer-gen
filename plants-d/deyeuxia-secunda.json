    "intro": "Deyeuxia secunda, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deyeuxia secunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
