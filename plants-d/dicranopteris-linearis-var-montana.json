    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain cliff brake, is a fern species native to Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky slopes and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the veins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
