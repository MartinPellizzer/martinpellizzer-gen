    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 bittyuense, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sphaericum. It is a type of fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to its substrate and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates."
