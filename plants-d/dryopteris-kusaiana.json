    "intro": "Dryopteris kusaiana, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months."
