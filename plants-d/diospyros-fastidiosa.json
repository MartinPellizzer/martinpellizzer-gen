It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red fruits resembling persimmons. Its fruit is edible, though some varieties may have astringent or bitter flavors, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in some regions for its unique appearance and potential economic uses."
