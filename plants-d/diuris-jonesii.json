    "intro": "Diuris jonesii, commonly known as Jones' spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with long, narrow petals and a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in heathlands and woodland areas, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to early spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Diuris jonesii is a perennial herb, often forming a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat."
