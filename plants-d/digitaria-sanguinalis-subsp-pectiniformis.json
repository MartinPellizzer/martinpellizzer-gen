    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis subsp. pectiniformis, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist to wet environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The species is characterized by its distinctive, soft, and hairy appearance, which helps in its identification in the field."
