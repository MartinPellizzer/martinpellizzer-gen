    "intro": "Dodecastigma integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dodecastigma, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and vines. The plant is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with four to five petals. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
