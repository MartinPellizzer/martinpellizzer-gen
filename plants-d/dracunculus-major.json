    "intro": "Dracunculus major, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like white flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. Its roots are tuberous and can grow quite deep in the soil. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
