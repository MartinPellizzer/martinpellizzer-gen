    "intro": "Dendrosenecio adnivalis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
