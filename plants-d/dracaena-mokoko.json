    "intro": "Dracaena mokoko, commonly known as the red-tipped dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green with a striking red or pink stripe along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena mokoko is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
