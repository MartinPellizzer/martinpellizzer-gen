    "intro": "Dryopteris atrospinosa, commonly known as the black scale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
