    "intro": "Diplospora kunstleri, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.

The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive spurred petal. Its leaves are thick, velvety, and typically have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention.
