    "intro": "Discaria, commonly known as the \"devil's lettuce,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It comprises about 40 species, predominantly found in Australia and New Zealand, with some species extending into Southeast Asia. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their alternate, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Discaria species are known for their ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments, making them well-adapted to harsh conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are valued for their ornamental appeal."
