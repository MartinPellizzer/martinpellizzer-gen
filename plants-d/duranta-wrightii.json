It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 10 feet tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by bright blue or purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans.
