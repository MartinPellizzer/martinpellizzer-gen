    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 alejandrei, commonly known as the Alejandri's wood fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from several Dryopteris species. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded garden spaces."
