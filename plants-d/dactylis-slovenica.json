    "intro": "Dactylis slovenica, commonly known as Slovenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Dactylis slovenica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
