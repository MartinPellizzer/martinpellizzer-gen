    "intro": "Drymaria paposana, commonly known as the Mexican sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Drymaria paposana is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
