    "intro": "Doryopteris skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Doryopteris skinneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
