    "intro": "Draba subsecunda, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded seed pods. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. Draba subsecunda is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few plants can survive."
