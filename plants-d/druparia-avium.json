    "intro": "Druparia avium, commonly known as the silverleaf drupe, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits called drupes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. These drupes are edible and contain a single seed enclosed in a hard pit. Druparia avium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
