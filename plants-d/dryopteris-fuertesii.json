    "intro": "Dryopteris fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently in its native habitat. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
