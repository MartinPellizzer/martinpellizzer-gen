    "intro": "Dysosma guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi dysosma, is a rare climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Guangxi, China. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that mature to a dark color, often containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dysosma guangxiensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
