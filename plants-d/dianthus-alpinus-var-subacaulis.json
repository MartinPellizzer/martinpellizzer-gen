    "intro": "Dianthus alpinus var. subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other dianthus species and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
