    "intro": "Dryopteris kanukuana, commonly known as the Kanuku fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in the nutrient-poor environments where it thrives. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid environments."
