    "intro": "Dendrobium xanthophaeum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium xanthophaeum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
