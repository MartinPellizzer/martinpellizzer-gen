    "intro": "Digitaria tarapacana, commonly known as the \"Altohu\u00e9\" or \"Puna grass,\" is a perennial grass native to the high Andean regions of South America. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Digitaria tarapacana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
