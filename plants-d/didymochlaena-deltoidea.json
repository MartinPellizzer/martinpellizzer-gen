    "intro": "Didymochlaena deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its natural habitat."
