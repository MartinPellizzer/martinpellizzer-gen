    "intro": "Davallia stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hoya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia stenolepis is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
