    "intro": "Dichrotrichum angiense, commonly known as the red-stemmed feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and distinctive red stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Dichrotrichum angiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
