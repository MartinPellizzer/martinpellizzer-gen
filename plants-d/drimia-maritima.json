    "intro": "Drimia maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and capable of storing water, aiding survival in arid conditions. Sea kale is often found in dune environments and is valued for its edible leaves and ornamental appeal."
