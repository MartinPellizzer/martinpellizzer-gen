It is a small shrub characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
