    "intro": "Dryopteris aspidioides var. subhastata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the aspidioides fern species. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
