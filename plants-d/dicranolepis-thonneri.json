    "intro": "Dicranolepis thonneri, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dicranolepis thonneri is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
