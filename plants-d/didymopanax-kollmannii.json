    "intro": "Didymopanax kollmannii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, composed of numerous leaflets arranged in a distinctive feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its dense, dark wood, it has been historically valued for use in furniture and musical instruments."
