    "intro": "Doronicum sinuatum, commonly known as the Sinuous Buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, sinuate (notched) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the end of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Doronicum sinuatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
