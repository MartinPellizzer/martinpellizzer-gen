    "intro": "Dracaena stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often variegated with green and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena stenophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
