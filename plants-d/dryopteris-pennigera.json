    "intro": "Dryopteris pennigera, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a slender, upright growth habit. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Dryopteris pennigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
