    "intro": "Dyckia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, violet to pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Dyckia tomentella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
