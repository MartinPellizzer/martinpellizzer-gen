It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, with flower stalks splitting into two or more branches near the top. This variety is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
