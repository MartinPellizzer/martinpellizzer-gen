    "intro": "Doryopteris rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often reddish at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Doryopteris rufa is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
