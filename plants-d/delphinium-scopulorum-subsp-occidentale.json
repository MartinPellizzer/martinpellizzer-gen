It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
