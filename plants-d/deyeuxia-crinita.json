    "intro": "Deyeuxia crinita, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Deyeuxia crinita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
