    "intro": "Draba alpina var. inflatisiliqua, commonly known as the inflated-siliqua rockcress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a hairy surface. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated silique that persists through winter, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
