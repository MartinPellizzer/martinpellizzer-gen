    "intro": "Dryopteris borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas' wood fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its robust, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Dryopteris borbasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
