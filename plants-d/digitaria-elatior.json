    "intro": "Digitaria elatior, commonly known as tall fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Digitaria elatior is also recognized for its potential use in erosion control due to its dense root system."
