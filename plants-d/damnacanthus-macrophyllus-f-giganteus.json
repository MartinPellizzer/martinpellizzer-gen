    "intro": "Damnacanthus macrophyllus f. giganteus, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its dramatic visual impact in gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is broad and glossy, adding to its ornamental value."
