    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudogueintziana, commonly known as the Gueintziana wood fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
