    "intro": "Dorstenia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly false arum, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, often twisted inflorescence that resembles a false arum, and its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves. The plant typically grows as a climbing or trailing vine, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and the flowers are small and clustered in a spadix-like structure. Dorstenia pubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
