    "intro": "Dracaena cincta, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its striking, horizontal stripes on its dark green leaves, which give it a unique and eye-catching appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena cincta is a popular indoor plant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify the air."
