It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and a single, showy spike of flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet or purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides, and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Dactylorhiza stortonii is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable environments."
