    "intro": "Dalbergia velutina var. succirubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is listed as a vulnerable species in many regions."
