    "intro": "Dyckia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces compact inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Dyckia biflora is adapted to grow in sunny, well-drained environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
