    "intro": "Delphinium speciosum var. ranunculifolium, commonly known as the ranunculifolium larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of buttercups, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rocky landscapes."
