    "intro": "Dipsacus pinnatifidus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The leaves are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiny, bristled seed pods. This plant is known for its ornamental value but can be invasive in certain regions."
