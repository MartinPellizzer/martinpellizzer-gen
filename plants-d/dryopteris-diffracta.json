    "intro": "Dryopteris diffracta, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's robust rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
