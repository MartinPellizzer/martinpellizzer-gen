    "intro": "Dudleya bettinae, commonly known as the Betts' Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to lavender during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
