    "intro": "Dendrobium barisanum, commonly known as the Barisan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium barisanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
