    "intro": "Dendrochilum microscopicum, commonly known as the minute dendrochilum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often overlooked due to their minute size. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The orchid's flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
