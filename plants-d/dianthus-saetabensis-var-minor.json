    "intro": "Dianthus saetabensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser thorned pink, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, vibrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its slightly hairy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
