    "intro": "Dicranolepis humillima, commonly known as the small fern, is a low-growing, perennial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Dicranolepis humillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
