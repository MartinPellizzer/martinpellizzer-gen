    "intro": "Dionaea sensitiva, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North and South Carolina. It features specialized leaves that are divided into two lobes, each with a pair of tooth-like structures. When an insect touches the sensitive trigger hairs, the leaves snap shut rapidly, trapping the prey. The plant digests the captured insect using digestive enzymes secreted from its leaf tissue. This unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soil environments."
