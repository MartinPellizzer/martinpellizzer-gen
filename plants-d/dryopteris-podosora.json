    "intro": "Dryopteris podosora, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often form a carpet-like appearance. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. This fern is well adapted to harsh conditions and is a common sight in mountainous regions."
