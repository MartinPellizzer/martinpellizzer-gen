It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense, compact form. Dichapetalum neglectum is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
