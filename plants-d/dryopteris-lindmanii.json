    "intro": "Dryopteris lindmanii, commonly known as the Lindman\u2019s wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
