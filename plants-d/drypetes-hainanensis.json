    "intro": "Drypetes hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan drypetes, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including southern China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruits, which contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
