It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a delicate, fragrant scent. Dianthus litoralis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, dunes, and rocky shores."
