    "intro": "Dalea multiflora, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like seed pods are typical of the legume family, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. Dalea multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
