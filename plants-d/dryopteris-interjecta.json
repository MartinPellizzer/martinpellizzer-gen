    "intro": "Dryopteris interjecta, commonly known as the interrupted wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a unique pattern of lobes and pinnae, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The interrupted wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens."
