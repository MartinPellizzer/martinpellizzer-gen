    "intro": "Demorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Demorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
