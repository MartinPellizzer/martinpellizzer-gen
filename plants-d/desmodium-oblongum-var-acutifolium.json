It features trifoliate leaves with elongated, acuminate leaflets that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in forage and soil conservation."
