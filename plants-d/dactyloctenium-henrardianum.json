It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential forage for livestock."
