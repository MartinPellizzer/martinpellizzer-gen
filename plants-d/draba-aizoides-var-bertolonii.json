    "intro": "Draba aizoides var. bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous areas with harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
