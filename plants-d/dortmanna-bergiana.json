    "intro": "Dortmanna bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinct, granular upper surface. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. It is often found in shaded, moist environments, which support its slow growth rate. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and habitat health."
