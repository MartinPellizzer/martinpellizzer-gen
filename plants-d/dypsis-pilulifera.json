    "intro": "Dypsis pilulifera, commonly known as the button fern, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its dense, compact foliage. The plant features a short, stout stem with clusters of lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Dypsis pilulifera is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
