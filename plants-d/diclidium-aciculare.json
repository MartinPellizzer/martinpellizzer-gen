It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often yellow or greenish in color. Diclidium aciculare is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
