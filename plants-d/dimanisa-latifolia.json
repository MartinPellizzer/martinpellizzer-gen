    "intro": "Dimanisa latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dimanisa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
