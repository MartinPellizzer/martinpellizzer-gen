It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with fine, hair-like structures along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
