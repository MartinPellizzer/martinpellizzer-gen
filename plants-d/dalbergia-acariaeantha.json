It is characterized by its dark, highly aromatic wood, which is prized for its density and fine grain. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
