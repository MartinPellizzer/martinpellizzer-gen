    "intro": "Delphinium pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Delphinium pallidiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal but is also toxic to livestock and humans."
