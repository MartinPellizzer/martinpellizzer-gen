    "intro": "Dryopteris raddeana var. talyschensis, commonly known as the Talyschenskaya wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 1\u20132 meters in length. The fronds are divided into pinnate segments with a distinct, serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters along the veins."
