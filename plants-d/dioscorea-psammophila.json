    "intro": "Dioscorea psammophila, commonly known as the sand dune yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its fibrous, tuberous roots that store nutrients. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, while its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The tubers of Dioscorea psammophila are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species."
