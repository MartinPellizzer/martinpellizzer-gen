    "intro": "Donaldia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Donaldia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many Donaldia species are now critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for their survival."
