The plant typically has basal leaves that are rosette-forming and hairy, while its flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Draba hederifolia thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is known for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments due to its compact growth habit and winter-hardy nature."
