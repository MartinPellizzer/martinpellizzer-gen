    "intro": "Dryopteris contigua, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris contigua is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
