    "intro": "Dracaena atropurpurea var. griffithii, commonly known as the Red Margin Dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems with dark green, narrow leaves that have distinctive red or purple margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its foliage can be pruned to maintain shape, and it is relatively low maintenance once established."
