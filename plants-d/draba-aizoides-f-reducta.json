    "intro": "Draba aizoides f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced Draba, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, including parts of the Alps and the Carpathians. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
