    "intro": "Dryas lanata, commonly known as the woolly dryas, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh cold and wind. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
