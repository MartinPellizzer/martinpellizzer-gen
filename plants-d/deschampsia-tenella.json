    "intro": "Deschampsia tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets. Deschampsia tenella is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
