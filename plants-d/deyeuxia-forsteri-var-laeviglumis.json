    "intro": "Deyeuxia forsteri var. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smooth lemma sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often clustered, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely arranged, and the lemma is smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food for various wildlife species."
