    "intro": "Dendrobium tentaculatum, commonly known as the tentacle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium tentaculatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
