    "intro": "Dryopteris tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapoto holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
