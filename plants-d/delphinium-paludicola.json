    "intro": "Delphinium paludicola, commonly known as the marsh delphinium, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Delphinium paludicola is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
