    "intro": "Drymocallis glandulosa subsp. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
