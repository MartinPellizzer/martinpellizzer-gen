    "intro": "Davallia \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid fern or the silver sword fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Davallia canariensis and Davallia mariae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
