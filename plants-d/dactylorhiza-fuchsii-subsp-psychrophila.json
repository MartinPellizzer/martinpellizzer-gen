    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. psychrophila, commonly known as the alpine lady's-tongue, is a rare orchid species adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a terrestrial orchid, lacking the typical rhizomes found in many other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
