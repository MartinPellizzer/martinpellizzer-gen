    "intro": "Dioscorea tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
