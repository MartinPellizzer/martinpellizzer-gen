    "intro": "Dendrobium anisobulbon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. It prefers shady, humid environments with well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shade gardens and terrariums."
