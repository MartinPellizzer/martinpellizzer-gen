    "intro": "Dactylorhiza triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its three leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodlands and heaths. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland understories."
