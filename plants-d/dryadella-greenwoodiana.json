The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
