It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It produces a single spike of flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
