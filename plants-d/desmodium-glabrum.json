    "intro": "Desmodium glabrum, commonly known as hairy leadplant, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria. Its fibrous root system helps in soil stabilization and erosion control."
