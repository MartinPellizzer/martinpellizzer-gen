    "intro": "Draba verna var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the spring whitlow, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its low-growing habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in disturbed areas. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming period, it is a notable species in early spring botanical surveys."
