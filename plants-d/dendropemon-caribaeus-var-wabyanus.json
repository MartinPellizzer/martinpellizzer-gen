    "intro": "Dendropemon caribaeus var. wabyanus, commonly known as the Wabyan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on limestone substrates. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, making it a unique addition to the local flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
