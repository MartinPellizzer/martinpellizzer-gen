    "intro": "Dicalix shunningensis, commonly known as the Shunning Valley orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Shunning Valley. It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals and a unique, spiral-shaped floral structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
