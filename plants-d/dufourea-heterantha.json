    "intro": "Dufourea heterantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dufourea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution. Dufourea heterantha is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
