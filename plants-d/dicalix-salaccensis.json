    "intro": "Dicalix salaccensis, commonly known as the Borneo star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological significance in the region's biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dicalix salaccensis is considered a vulnerable species."
