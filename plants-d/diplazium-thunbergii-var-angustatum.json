    "intro": "Diplazium thunbergii var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
