    "intro": "Dryopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
