    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis f. intercedens, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
