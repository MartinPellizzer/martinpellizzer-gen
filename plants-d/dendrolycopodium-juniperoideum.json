    "intro": "Dendrolycopodium juniperoideum, commonly known as the Juniper-like clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
