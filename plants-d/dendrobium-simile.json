    "intro": "Dendrobium simile, commonly known as the common orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical climates. Dendrobium simile is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
