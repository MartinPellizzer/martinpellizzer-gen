It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
