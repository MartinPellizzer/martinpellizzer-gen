    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. altaica, commonly known as the tall bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to blue in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
