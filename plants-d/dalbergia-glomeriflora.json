    "intro": "Dalbergia glomeriflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its economic value, it is also subject to overharvesting and habitat loss, leading to conservation concerns."
