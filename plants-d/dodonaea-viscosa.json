    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa, commonly known as velvet leaf or silver dollar tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia and other parts of the world. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
