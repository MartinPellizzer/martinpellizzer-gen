    "intro": "Diodia radula subsp. venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan sandweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often in coastal or arid regions. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other Diodia species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
