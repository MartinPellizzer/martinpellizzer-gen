It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with spoon-shaped, toothed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, showy head, which attracts various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
