    "intro": "Dicardiotis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a bright yellow flower head that develops into a spherical, crown-like seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Dicardiotis is a perennial herb that is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
