    "intro": "Dryopteris vivipara var. platypes, commonly known as the broad-leaf male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, broadly ovate to triangular fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role."
