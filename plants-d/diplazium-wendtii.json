    "intro": "Diplazium wendtii, commonly known as the Wendt's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile and sterile fronds emerging from the same rhizome. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Diplazium wendtii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
