    "intro": "Delphinium hirsutum, commonly known as the hirsute larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hirsutum\" name, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. Delphinium hirsutum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens but is toxic to humans and animals due to its presence of alkaloids."
