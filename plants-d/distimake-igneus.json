    "intro": "Distimake igneus, commonly known as the flameleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like orange and red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
