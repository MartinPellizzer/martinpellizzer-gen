    "intro": "Decaneurum serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in a triangular cross-section. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom late in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Decaneurum serotinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
