It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f, with narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence is a dense panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.
