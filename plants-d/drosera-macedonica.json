    "intro": "Drosera macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red. Drosera macedonica is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to the lack of fertile soil in its habitat."
