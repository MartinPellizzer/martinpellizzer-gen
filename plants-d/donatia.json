    "intro": "Donatia, commonly known as the \"false mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and they produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Donatia species are characterized by their fibrous, woody stems and their ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
