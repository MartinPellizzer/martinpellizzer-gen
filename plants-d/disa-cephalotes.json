    "intro": "Disa cephalotes, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, which is a defining feature of many orchids. Disa cephalotes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
