    "intro": "Dasylirion juncifolium, commonly known as the threadleaf sotol, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dasylirion juncifolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
