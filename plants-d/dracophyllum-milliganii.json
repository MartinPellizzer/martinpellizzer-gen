    "intro": "Dracophyllum milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's drab, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
