    "intro": "Diplazium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
