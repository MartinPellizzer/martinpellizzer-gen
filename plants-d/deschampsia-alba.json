    "intro": "Deschampsia alba, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-white hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Deschampsia alba is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
