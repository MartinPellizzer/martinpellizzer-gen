    "intro": "Diplacus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf trumpetflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Diplacus pygmaeus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
