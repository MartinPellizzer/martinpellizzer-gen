    "intro": "Dicksonia wendlandii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its trunk is composed of a dense mass of root-like structures called rhizomes, which store water and nutrients. Dicksonia wendlandii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests."
