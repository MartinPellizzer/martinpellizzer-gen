    "intro": "Dicerma biarticulatum var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian flatback spider, is a species of orb-weaving spider found primarily in Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, and often brightly colored carapace, which provides camouflage in its natural habitat. The spider constructs circular, sheet-like webs, typically in shrubs or trees, to catch flying insects. Its venom is relatively mild compared to other spider species, making it less dangerous to humans. This variety is notable for its adaptability to various environments across the Australian continent."
