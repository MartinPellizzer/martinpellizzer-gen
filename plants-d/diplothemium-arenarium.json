    "intro": "Diplothemium arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on exposed rock surfaces, particularly sandstone, in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is composed of a dense, leathery layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae or cyanobacteria. Its color ranges from pale green to yellowish-green, depending on the moisture content and light exposure. This lichen is known for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it an indicator species for rocky, dry habitats."
