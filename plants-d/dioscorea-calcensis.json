    "intro": "Dioscorea calcensis, commonly known as the limestone yam, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The tubers of Dioscorea calcensis contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use."
