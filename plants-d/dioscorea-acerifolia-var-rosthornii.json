    "intro": "Dioscorea acerifolia var. rosthornii, commonly known as the rosthornii yam, is a variant of the yam genus native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its palmate, lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are less commonly cultivated compared to other yam varieties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests."
