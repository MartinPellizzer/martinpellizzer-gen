    "intro": "Danthonia juncea, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia juncea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
