    "intro": "Drypetes usambarica var. rugulosa, commonly known as the Usambara drypetes, is a shrub or small tree native to the East African coastal forests. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
