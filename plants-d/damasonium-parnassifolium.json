It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
