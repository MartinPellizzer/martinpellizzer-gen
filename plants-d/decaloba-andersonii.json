    "intro": "Decaloba andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's decaloba, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture, and the flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
