    "intro": "Dichorexia, commonly known as the \"two-seed grass,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-seed structure, which sets it apart from other grasses. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that contain two seeds each. Dichorexia plays a minor role in local ecosystems, primarily as a source of forage for small herbivores."
