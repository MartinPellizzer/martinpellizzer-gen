    "intro": "Dryopteris submonticola, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, serrated margin. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
