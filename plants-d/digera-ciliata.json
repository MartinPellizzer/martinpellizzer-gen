    "intro": "Digera ciliata, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens."
