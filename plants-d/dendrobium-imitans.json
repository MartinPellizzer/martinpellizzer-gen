    "intro": "Dendrobium imitans, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct, intricate pattern that resembles other orchid species, hence its common name. Dendrobium imitans thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
