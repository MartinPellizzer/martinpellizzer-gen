    "intro": "Dorycnium herbaceum subsp. sabaudum, commonly known as the Sabaudian burclover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a pod that contains several elongated, hooked seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields."
