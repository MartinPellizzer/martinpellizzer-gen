    "intro": "Delissea kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant grows on tree trunks or branches, often in humid, shaded environments, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements make it a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
