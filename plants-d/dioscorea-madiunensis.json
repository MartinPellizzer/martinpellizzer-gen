It is a climbing vine characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and twining. The tubers of Dioscorea madiunensis are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
