    "intro": "Dichilanthe borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean dichilanthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, lowland areas and is often found in swampy or disturbed habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually green or pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
