    "intro": "Dianella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf flax lily, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like ground cover. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Dianella humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
