    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, holly-like leaves that are often covered with tiny, spiny protrusions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, serrated edge that gives it its common name. Dryopteris aculeata produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
