    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. geomastrix, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered together. This variety is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense ground cover. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
