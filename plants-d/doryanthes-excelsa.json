It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove. Doryanthes excelsa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
