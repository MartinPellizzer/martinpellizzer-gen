    "intro": "Dracaena speciosa, commonly known as the flamingo plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with a distinctive red or orange edge, giving it its dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena speciosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
