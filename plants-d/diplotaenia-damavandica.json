    "intro": "Diplotaenia damavandica, commonly known as the Damavand thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alborz Mountains in Iran. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, pale blue to purple composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Diplotaenia damavandica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat."
