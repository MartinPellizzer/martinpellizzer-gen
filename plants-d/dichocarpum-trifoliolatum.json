    "intro": "Dichocarpum trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central axis. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
