It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
