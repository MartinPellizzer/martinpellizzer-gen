    "intro": "Drakonorchis barbarella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, which is characteristic of many orchid species. The narrow-leaved orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, well-drained environments."
