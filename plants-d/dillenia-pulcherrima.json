    "intro": "Dillenia pulcherrima, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Americas, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that encase its seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Dillenia pulcherrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
