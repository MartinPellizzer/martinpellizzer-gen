    "intro": "Dicraeanthus parmelioides, commonly known as the lichen-like plant or false lichen, is a unique species that exhibits characteristics of both algae and fungi. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant forms a crust-like growth that is often difficult to distinguish from true lichens. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Dicraeanthus parmelioides plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
