    "intro": "Dennstaedtia punctilobula f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate woodsorrel, is a fern characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique appearance. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often described as delicate and ornamental, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. The varietal form 'cristata' is distinguished by its curled, wave-like leaf margins, which contribute to its ornamental value."
