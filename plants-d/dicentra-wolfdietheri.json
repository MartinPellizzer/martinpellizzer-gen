    "intro": "Dicentra wolfdietheri, commonly known as the Wolfdiether's bleeding heart, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically appearing in spring. The plant has fern-like, trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
