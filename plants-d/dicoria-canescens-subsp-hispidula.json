    "intro": "Dicoria canescens subsp. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy dicoria, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. Dicoria canescens subsp. hispidula is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
