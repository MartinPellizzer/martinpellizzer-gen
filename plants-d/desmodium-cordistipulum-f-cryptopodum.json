    "intro": "Desmodium cordistipulum f. cryptopodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desmodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
