It features smooth, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its berries, which are bright red and fleshy, are highly toxic but attractive to birds. The plant contains tropane alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine, which have both medicinal and poisonous properties."
