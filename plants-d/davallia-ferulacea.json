    "intro": "Davallia ferulacea, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Davallia ferulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
