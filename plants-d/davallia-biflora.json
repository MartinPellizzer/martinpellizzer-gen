    "intro": "Davallia biflora, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that resemble the feet of a hare, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the leaves."
