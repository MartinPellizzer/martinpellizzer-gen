    "intro": "Dorstenia contensis, commonly known as the \"tropical orchid vine,\" is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dorstenia contensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to climb or trail."
