    "intro": "Dendrobium praemorsum, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, dark purple or black flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from a modified leaf, known as a bract. Dendrobium praemorsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its dramatic and unusual floral display."
