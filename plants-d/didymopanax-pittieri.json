It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its native arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
