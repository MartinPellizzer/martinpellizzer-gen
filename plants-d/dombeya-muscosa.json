    "intro": "Dombeya muscosa, commonly known as the silky dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white downy foliage and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its flowers are often pink or white, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Dombeya muscosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
