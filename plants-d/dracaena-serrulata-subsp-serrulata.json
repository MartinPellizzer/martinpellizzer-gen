    "intro": "Dracaena serrulata subsp. serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dracaena, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
