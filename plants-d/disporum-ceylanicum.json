It is native to the forests of Sri Lanka and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pale green berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
