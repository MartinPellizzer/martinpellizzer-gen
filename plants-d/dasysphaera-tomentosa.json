    "intro": "Dasysphaera tomentosa, commonly known as the silky rock daisy, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
