    "intro": "Diplusodon microphyllus var. capitatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diplusodon, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are often borne at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is usually herbaceous, with a low, spreading form that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
