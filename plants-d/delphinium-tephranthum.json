    "intro": "Delphinium tephranthum, commonly known as the Tephranthum larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Delphinium tephranthum is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes."
