    "intro": "Dichapetalum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's dichapetalum, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
