    "intro": "Discaria nana var. inermis, commonly known as the dwarf discaria or small-leaved discaria, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
