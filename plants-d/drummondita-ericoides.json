    "intro": "Drummondita ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Drummondita ericoides thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. It is a popular choice for native gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
