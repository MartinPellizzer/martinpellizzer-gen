    "intro": "Digitaria nervosa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Digitaria nervosa is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
