    "intro": "Dendrobium grootingsii, commonly known as the Grootings' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, and it blooms during the dry season. Dendrobium grootingsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
