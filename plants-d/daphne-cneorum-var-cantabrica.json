    "intro": "Daphne cneorum var. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian daphne, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a strong, spicy fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
