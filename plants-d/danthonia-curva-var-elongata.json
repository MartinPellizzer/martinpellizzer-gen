    "intro": "Danthonia curva var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue-green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
