It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that bear numerous ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.
