    "intro": "Draba chrysantha var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy stem whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features a basal rosette of hairy, oblanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its hairy stems and leaves are characteristic adaptations to its arid and rocky habitats. It is often found in open areas such as gravelly slopes and dry meadows."
