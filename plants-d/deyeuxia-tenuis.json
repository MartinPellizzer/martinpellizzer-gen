    "intro": "Deyeuxia tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf false rice, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, and it blooms during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Deyeuxia tenuis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
