    "intro": "Dissotis simonis-jamesii, commonly known as the Jamesii dissotis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
