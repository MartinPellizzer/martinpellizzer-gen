    "intro": "Dendrobium sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to form pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium sublobatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
