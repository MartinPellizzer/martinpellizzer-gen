    "intro": "Desmodium dimorphum, commonly known as the twinleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with two distinct leaflets on one side and one on the other, giving it its common name. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in summer. Desmodium dimorphum is often found in prairies and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
