    "intro": "Dombeya punctata var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated margins, contributing to its common name. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and compact growth habit."
