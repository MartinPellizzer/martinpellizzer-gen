    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leafed goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of the ash tree, with a grayish-green hue on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
