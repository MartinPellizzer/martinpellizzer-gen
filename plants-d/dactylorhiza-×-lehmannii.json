    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 lehmannii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near waterlogged soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears spike-like inflorescences of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza macdougallii and Dactylorhiza viridiflora. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and fen meadows."
