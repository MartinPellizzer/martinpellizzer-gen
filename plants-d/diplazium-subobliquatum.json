It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second."
