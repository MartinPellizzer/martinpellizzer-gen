It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, spiny fruits known as achenes. It is native to various regions in the Americas and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
