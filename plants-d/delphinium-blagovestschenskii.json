    "intro": "[WRONG START] Delphinium blagovetschenskii, commonly known as the Blagovetschensk bluebell, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
