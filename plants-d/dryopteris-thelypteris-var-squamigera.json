    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris var. squamigera, commonly known as the scalloped shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often curled and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically a deep green, with a silvery underside that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures."
