    "intro": "Dendrobium kentrochilum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or golden, with a distinctive spurred shape, and bloom during the summer months. Dendrobium kentrochilum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
