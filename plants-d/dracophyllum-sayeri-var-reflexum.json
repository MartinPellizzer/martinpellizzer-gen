    "intro": "Dracophyllum sayeri var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed dracophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in winter. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) tip, which is a key identifying feature. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
