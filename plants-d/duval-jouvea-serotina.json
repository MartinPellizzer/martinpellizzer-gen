    "intro": "Duval-jouvea serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering duval-jouvea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and dark green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
