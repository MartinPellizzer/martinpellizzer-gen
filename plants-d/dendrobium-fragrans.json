    "intro": "Dendrobium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Dendrobium fragrans is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in various regions."
