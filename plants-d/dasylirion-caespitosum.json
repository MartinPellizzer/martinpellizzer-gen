    "intro": "Dasylirion caespitosum, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use by indigenous peoples."
