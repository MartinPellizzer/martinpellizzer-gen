It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. Native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has rhizomes that grow horizontally and produce clustered, spore-bearing sorus structures.
