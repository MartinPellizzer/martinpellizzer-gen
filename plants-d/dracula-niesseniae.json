    "intro": "Dracula niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and purple flowers, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific species of bees. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
