    "intro": "Drepananthus deltoideus, commonly known as the delta-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually green but may turn reddish in certain conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its botanical structure is adapted for parasitic growth, with specialized roots called haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system."
