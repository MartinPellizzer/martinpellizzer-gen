    "intro": "Dianthus galicicae, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dianthus galicicae is often found in meadows, slopes, and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
