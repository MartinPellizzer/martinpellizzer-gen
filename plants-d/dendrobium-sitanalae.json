    "intro": "Dendrobium sitanalae, commonly known as the Sitana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high light exposure. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
