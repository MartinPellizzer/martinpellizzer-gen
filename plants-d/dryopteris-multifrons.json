    "intro": "Dryopteris multifrons, commonly known as the broad-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle."
