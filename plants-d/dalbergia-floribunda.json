It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain flattened seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
