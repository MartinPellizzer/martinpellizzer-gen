    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum subsp. laxiusculum, commonly known as the lax flower delphinium, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which consists of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves."
