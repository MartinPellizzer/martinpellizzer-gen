    "intro": "Dissanthelium supinum, commonly known as the prostrate false panic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, spreading stems that often lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are usually inconspicuous and clustered near the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent during the growing season. Dissanthelium supinum is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as roadsides and sandy soils."
