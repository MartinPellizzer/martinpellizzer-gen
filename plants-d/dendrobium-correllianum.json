    "intro": "Dendrobium correllianum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in horticulture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
