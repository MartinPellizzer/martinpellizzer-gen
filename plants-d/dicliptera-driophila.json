    "intro": "Dicliptera driophila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-chambered flowers. Dicliptera driophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
