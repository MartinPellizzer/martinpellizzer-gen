It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stems and more rounded leaves compared to other Dianthus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
