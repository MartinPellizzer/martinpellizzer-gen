    "intro": "Dolichanthera neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia long-flowered orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated floral structures that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the humid, shaded understory of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
