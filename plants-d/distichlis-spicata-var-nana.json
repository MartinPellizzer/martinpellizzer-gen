    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf saltgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. Its compact growth habit and drought resistance make it well-suited for erosion control in arid and coastal regions."
