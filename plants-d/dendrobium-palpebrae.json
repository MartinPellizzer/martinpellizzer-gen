    "intro": "Dendrobium palpebrae, commonly known as the eye-lid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive pattern resembling eyelids, giving it its common name. Dendrobium palpebrae thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
