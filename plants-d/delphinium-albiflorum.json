    "intro": "Delphinium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
