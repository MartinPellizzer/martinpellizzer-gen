    "intro": "Dryopteris latebrosa, commonly known as the latebrook wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
