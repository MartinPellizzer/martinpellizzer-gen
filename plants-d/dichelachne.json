    "intro": "Dichelachne, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of grasses. Dichelachne species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
