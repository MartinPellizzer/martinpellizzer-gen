    "intro": "Disecocarpus, commonly known as the fern tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They produce capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. Disecocarpus species are often valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in horticulture for their attractive foliage and blooms."
