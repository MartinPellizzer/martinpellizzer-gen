    "intro": "Davallia longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features arching, slender fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
