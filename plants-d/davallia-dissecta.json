    "intro": "Davallia dissecta, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central, undivided portion and lobed margins. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces new growth from the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
