It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Diandranthus tibeticus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
