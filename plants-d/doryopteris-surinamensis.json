    "intro": "Doryopteris surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Doryopteris surinamensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
