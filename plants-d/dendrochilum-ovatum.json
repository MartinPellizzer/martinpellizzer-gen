    "intro": "Dendrochilum ovatum, commonly known as the oval-lipped tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive oval lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. Dendrochilum ovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
