    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant."
