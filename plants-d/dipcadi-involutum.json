    "intro": "Dipcadi involutum, commonly known as the curled bulbous plant, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the bulb. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid regions."
