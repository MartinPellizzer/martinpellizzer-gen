    "intro": "Delphinium dasycaulon var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
