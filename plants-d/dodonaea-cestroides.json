It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and narrow, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Dodonaea cestroides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
