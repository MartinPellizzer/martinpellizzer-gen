It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red throat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Dendrobium rumphiae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
