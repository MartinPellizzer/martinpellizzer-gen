    "intro": "Deyeuxia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Deyeuxia brevifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
