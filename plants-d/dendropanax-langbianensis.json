    "intro": "Dendropanax langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian arrowleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
