    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. humilis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas."
