    "intro": "Deyeuxia quadriseta var. montana, commonly known as mountain false brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
