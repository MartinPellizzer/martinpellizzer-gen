    "intro": "Decaspermum rubrum, commonly known as the red-spored spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive red, fleshy seed pods that split open to release seeds when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are typically simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
