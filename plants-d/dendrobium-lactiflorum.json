    "intro": "Dendrobium lactiflorum, commonly known as the milk-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive milk-like scent. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers typically bloom in summer and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Dendrobium lactiflorum is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
