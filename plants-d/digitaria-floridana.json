    "intro": "Digitaria floridana, commonly known as Florida grass or Florida digitaria, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
