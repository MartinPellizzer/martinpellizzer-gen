    "intro": "Dryopteris serratodentata, commonly known as the serrated tooth fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with serrated margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
