    "intro": "Diplotropis strigulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive whitish or grayish coating. Diplotropis strigulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
