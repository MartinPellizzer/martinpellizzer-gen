    "intro": "Diplazium wichurae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. Diplazium wichurae typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species within its native range."
