    "intro": "Ditassa velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact is often considered negative due to its invasive nature."
