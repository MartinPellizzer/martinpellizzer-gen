    "intro": "Dipladenia polymorpha subvar. puberula, commonly known as the velvet leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its velvety, pubescent foliage that gives it its subspecies name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises, arbors, or as a ground cover in ornamental gardens."
