    "intro": "Dioscorea antaly, commonly known as the Antaly yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Its tubers are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet flavor, making them a valuable food source. The plant also contains compounds with potential health benefits, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
