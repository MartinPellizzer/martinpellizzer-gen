    "intro": "Dendrobium utriculariopsis, commonly known as the small utricularia orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with short, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium utriculariopsis is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
