    "intro": "Dampiera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate dampiera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Dampiera prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
