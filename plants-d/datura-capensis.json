    "intro": "Datura capensis, commonly known as the Cape night-flower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Datura capensis contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
