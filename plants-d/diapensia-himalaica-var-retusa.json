    "intro": "Diapensia himalaica var. retusa, commonly known as the Himalayan diapensia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and flowering plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers, typically white or pale pink, are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, slightly curled leaf tips, which are a key identifying feature."
