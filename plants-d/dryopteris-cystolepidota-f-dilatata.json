    "intro": "Dryopteris cystolepidota f. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions in North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a pale, often silvery underside, which is a key identifying trait. Its sori, which contain the spores, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodlands or along stream banks."
