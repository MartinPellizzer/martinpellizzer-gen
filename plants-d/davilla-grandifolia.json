    "intro": "Davilla grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruit display, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
