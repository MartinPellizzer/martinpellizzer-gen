    "intro": "Dioscorea kimiae, commonly known as Kimia's yam, is a species of tuberous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not widely cultivated for food. The botanical features of Dioscorea kimiae make it an interesting subject for ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
