    "intro": "Dapania monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf dapania, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its singular, large, heart-shaped leaf that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
