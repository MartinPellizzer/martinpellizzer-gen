    "intro": "Diplostephium igniarium, commonly known as the flameleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
