    "intro": "Draba rigida var. bryoides, commonly known as the rigid whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features a rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche, making it a resilient member of high-altitude vegetation."
