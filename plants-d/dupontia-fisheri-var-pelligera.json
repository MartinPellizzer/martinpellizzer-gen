    "intro": "Dupontia fisheri var. pelligera, commonly known as the Pelligera sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is characterized by its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed or barren landscapes."
