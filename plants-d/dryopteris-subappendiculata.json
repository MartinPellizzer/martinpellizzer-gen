    "intro": "Dryopteris subappendiculata, commonly known as the broad-crested wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a broad, upright shape and a distinctive, glossy green color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
