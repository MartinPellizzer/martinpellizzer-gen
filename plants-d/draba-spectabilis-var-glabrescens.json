It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which give the variety its name \"glabrescens.\" The showy whitlow grass is known for its early spring blooming period, adding a splash of color to high-altitude environments."
