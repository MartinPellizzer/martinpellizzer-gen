    "intro": "Dioscorea strydomiana, commonly known as the Strydom's yam, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The tubers of D. strydomiana are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
