    "intro": "Dendrobium brunneum, commonly known as the brown orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its stems are often segmented and can be somewhat woody, adapting to its environment. Dendrobium brunneum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
