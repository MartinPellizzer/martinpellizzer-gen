It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in the summer months. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
