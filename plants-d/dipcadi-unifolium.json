    "intro": "Dipcadi unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaf squill, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its single, basal leaf and a cluster of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
