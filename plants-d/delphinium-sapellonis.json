    "intro": "Delphinium sapellonis, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are composed of five sepals that resemble petals. Delphinium sapellonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
