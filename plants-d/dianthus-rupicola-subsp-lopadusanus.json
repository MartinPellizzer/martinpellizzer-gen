It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
