    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis var. exigua, commonly known as the small marginal fern, is a variant of the marginal wood fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
