    "intro": "Dryopteris semicordata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris semicordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
