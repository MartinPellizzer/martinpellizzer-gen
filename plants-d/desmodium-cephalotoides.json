    "intro": "Desmodium cephalotoides, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
