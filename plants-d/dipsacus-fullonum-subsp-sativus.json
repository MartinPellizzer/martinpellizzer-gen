    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum subsp. sativus, commonly known as teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hollow stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, cone-like seed heads. Teasel is often cultivated for its unique seeds, which are used in the textile industry for raising wool. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
