    "intro": "Dendropemon emarginatus, commonly known as the marginate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays a significant role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
