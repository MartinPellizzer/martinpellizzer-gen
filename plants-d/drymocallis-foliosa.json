    "intro": "Drymocallis foliosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow blooms. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Drymocallis foliosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
