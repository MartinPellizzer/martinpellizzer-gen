    "intro": "Drosera drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Drosera drummondii is a hardy species that can survive in harsh environments due to its ability to store water and nutrients from captured prey."
