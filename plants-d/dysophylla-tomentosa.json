    "intro": "Dysophylla tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dysophylla, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. Dysophylla tomentosa is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
