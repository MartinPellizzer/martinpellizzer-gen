It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
