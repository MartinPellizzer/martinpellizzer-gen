    "intro": "Dacrydium \u00d7 suprinii, commonly known as the hybrid rimu, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu) and Dacrydium bernardii (kahikatea). It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in the wetlands and swampy areas of New Zealand. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals around the stems. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. This hybrid is notable for its ecological role in New Zealand's native forests and its resilience in wetland environments."
