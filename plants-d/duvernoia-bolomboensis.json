    "intro": "Duvernoia bolomboensis, commonly known as the Bolombo duvernoia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
