    "intro": "Delosperma exspersum var. decumbens, commonly known as the carpet iceplant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread rapidly make it a hardy, ornamental plant for arid landscapes."
