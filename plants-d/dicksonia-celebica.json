    "intro": "Dicksonia celebica, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Dicksonia celebica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
