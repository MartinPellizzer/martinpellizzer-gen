    "intro": "Dipteranthus estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's dipteranthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from pink to red, and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
