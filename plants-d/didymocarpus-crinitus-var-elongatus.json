    "intro": "Didymocarpus crinitus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stalked hairy tamarind, is a variant of the tamarind genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its hairy, elongated stipules and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its botanical features make it distinct from other tamarind species, particularly in its foliage and fruit morphology. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
