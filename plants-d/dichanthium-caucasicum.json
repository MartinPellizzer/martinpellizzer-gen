It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Dichanthium caucasicum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
