    "intro": "Delissea leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved delissea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Delissea leiophylla is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
