    "intro": "Didymoglossum reptans var. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved moss, is a variant of the common creeping moss. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its common name. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually a dark green color and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from small, capsule-like structures that develop on the stems."
