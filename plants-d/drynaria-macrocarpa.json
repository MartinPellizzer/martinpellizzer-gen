    "intro": "Drynaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to grow in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in spherical, woody sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria macrocarpa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
