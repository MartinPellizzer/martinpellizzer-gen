    "intro": "Draba lactea var. tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender milkweed draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of 5 to 15 centimeters, with a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with four to six petals, and it is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
