    "intro": "Daphne lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in woodland and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
