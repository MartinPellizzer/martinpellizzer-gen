    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 stenostachys subsp. lehmannii, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome system. This subspecies is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Dactylorhiza sambucina and Dactylorhiza macdougallii."
