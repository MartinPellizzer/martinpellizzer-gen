    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. dependens, commonly known as the spreading male fern, is a variant of the male fern native to various parts of Asia. It is a fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile pinnae bearing sporangia on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
