    "intro": "Dyctiogramme japonica, commonly known as the Japanese dyctiogramme, is a rare and specialized fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, intricate leaf structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
