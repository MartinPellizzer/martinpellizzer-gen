    "intro": "Descantaria procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Descantaria procumbens is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
