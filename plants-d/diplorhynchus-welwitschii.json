    "intro": "Diplorhynchus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that allows it to survive in extremely arid conditions by accessing deep underground water sources. Diplorhynchus welwitschii is also notable for its ability to produce a resin that has been historically used by local communities. This plant is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
