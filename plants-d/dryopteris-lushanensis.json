    "intro": "Dryopteris lushanensis, commonly known as the Lushan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The Lushan wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
