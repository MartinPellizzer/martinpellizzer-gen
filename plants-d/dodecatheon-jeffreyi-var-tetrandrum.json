    "intro": "Dodecatheon jeffreyi var. tetrandrum, commonly known as the Jeffrey's glory-of-the-snow, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
