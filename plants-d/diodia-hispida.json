    "intro": "Diodia hispida, commonly known as roughleaf diodia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its hairy foliage and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Diodia hispida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
