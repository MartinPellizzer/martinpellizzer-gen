It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pink or white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
