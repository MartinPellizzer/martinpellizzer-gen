    "intro": "Diacalpe omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Diacalpe omeiensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
