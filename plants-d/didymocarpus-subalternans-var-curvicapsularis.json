    "intro": "Didymocarpus subalternans var. curvicapsularis, commonly known as the narrow-capsuled wild pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its small, glabrous leaves and distinctive, elongated fruits that mature to a dark purple color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a feature common in the Piperaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
