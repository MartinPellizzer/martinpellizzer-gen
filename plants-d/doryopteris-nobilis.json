    "intro": "Doryopteris nobilis, commonly known as the noble cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, narrow, and leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Doryopteris nobilis is often found in calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
