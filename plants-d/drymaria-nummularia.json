    "intro": "Drymaria nummularia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
