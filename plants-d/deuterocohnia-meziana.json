    "intro": "Deuterocohnia meziana, commonly known as the Mexican cushion plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, compact plant that forms dense, cushion-like rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its unique structure and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its natural habitat."
