    "intro": "Drosera pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem with small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Drosera pauciflora is a low-growing plant with a compact appearance, making it a unique addition to botanical collections."
