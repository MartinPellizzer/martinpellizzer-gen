    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting clusters of showy, spurred blue or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
