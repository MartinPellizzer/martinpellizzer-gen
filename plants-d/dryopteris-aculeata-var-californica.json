    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeata var. californica, commonly known as the California water fern, is a variant of the common sword fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically light green and slightly glossy. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, delicate appearance."
