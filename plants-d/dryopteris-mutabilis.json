    "intro": "Dryopteris mutabilis, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that can vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky habitats. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and ecological research."
