    "intro": "Dalea lutea var. longispica, commonly known as the yellow false indigo, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often grayish-green in color. This variety is distinguished by its long, slender spicules on the flower petals, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats."
