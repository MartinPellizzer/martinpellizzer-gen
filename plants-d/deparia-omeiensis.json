    "intro": "Deparia omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance that adds to its ornamental value."
