    "intro": "Dioscorea matudae, commonly known as the Matudae yam, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and oval-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they contain compounds that can be harmful if not prepared properly."
