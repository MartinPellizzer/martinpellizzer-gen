    "intro": "Dendrobium bilobum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its flowers typically bloom in summer and can last for several weeks. Dendrobium bilobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
