    "intro": "Dialium soyauxii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lanceolate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish-orange drupes. Its wood is highly valued for its fine texture and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
