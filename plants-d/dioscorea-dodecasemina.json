    "intro": "Dioscorea dodecasemina, commonly known as the twelve-leaf yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its cylindrical, tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The tuberous roots are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and herbal remedies."
