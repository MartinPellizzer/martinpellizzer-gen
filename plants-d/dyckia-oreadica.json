    "intro": "Dyckia oreadica, commonly known as the rock dyckia, is a perennial bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to purple, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Dyckia oreadica is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
