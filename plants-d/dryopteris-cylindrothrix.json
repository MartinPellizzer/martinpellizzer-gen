    "intro": "Dryopteris cylindrothrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
