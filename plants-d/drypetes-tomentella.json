    "intro": "Drypetes tomentella, commonly known as the wooly drypetes, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Drypetes tomentella is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
