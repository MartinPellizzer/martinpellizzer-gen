    "intro": "Deyeuxia srilankensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan flat sedge, is a perennial grass native to the wet zones of Sri Lanka. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in grasslands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
