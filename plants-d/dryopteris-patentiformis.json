    "intro": "Dryopteris patentiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies."
