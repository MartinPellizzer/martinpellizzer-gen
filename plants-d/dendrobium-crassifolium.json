    "intro": "Dendrobium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its tropical environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Dendrobium crassifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
