    "intro": "Dracaena indivisa var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is popular in indoor gardening due to its hardiness and ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions."
