    "intro": "Dactylorhiza graggeriana, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, marshes, and meadows. The plant has a slender, often reddish stem that bears several oval, leathery leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a loose spike, with each flower having a distinctive, spurred lip. The orchid's root system includes a network of mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
