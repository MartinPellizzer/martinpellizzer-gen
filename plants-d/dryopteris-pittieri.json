    "intro": "Dryopteris pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris pittieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
