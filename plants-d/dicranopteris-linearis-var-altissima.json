    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. altissima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to several meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams or wetlands. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
