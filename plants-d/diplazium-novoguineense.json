    "intro": "Diplazium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. Diplazium novoguineense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and understorey habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
