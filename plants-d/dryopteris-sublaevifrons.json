    "intro": "Dryopteris sublaevifrons, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are densely covered with small, rounded scales. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are broad and slightly curved, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
