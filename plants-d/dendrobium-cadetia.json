    "intro": "Dendrobium cadetia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming in clusters. Its stems are pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium cadetia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
