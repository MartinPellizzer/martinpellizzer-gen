    "intro": "Dryopteris oblongipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with broad, fan-like pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
