    "intro": "Dryopteris polyotis, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris polyotis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
