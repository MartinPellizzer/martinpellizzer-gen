    "intro": "Desmodium pseudarthrioides, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural settings. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods and are dispersed by wind or animals."
