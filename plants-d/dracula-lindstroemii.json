    "intro": "Dracula lindstroemii, commonly known as the Lindstrom's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often dark red or purple flowers that resemble a vampire's lips. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-drained, loose soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
