    "intro": "Deanea tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous dayflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the day. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Deanea tuberosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
