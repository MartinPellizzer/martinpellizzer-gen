    "intro": "Dalbergia monetaria var. nitida, commonly known as the white sand rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a ornamental plant."
