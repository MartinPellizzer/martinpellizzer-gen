    "intro": "Daucus edulis, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like cluster. Its fruit is a dry, ridged schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature. The plant is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
