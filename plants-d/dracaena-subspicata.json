    "intro": "Dracaena subspicata, commonly known as the fragrant dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena subspicata is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
