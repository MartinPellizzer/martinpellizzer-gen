    "intro": "Diplostephium juajibioyi, commonly known as the Jua Jibioy cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
