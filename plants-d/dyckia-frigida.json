    "intro": "Dyckia frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to southern Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that emerge from the leaf rosette. Dyckia frigida is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance."
