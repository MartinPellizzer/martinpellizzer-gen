    "intro": "Dracula pileus, commonly known as the vampire's hat, is a striking member of the Amanita family, native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped cap that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often with a distinctive, almost velvety texture. The cap is typically pale to reddish-brown, with a unique, almost skeletal appearance due to its irregular, wavy edges. Its gills are pale yellow and closely spaced, while the stem is thick, bulbous, and often covered in a sticky layer called a volva. Due to its striking appearance and association with the night, it has become a popular subject in both mycology and art."
