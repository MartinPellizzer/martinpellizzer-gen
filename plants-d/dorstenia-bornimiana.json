    "intro": "Dorstenia bornimiana, commonly known as the mountain spider plant, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Dorstenia bornimiana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
