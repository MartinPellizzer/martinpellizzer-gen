    "intro": "Dryadella sapucaiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian dryadella, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within dense tropical forests. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
