It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or rounded with a serrated margin. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Delpya muricata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
