    "intro": "Dimorphorchis beccarii var. beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
