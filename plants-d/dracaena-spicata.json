    "intro": "Dracaena spicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf dracaena, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its upright growth habit makes it an excellent choice for adding vertical interest to indoor spaces."
