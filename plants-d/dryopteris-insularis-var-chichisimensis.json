    "intro": "Dryopteris insularis var. chichisimensis, commonly known as the Chichisima fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Chichisima in the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
