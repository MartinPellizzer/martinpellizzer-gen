It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is also a subject of conservation concern in some areas."
