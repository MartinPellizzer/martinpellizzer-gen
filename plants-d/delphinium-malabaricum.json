    "intro": "Delphinium malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals that are often mistaken for petals, and it produces small, follicle-like fruits. Delphinium malabaricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
