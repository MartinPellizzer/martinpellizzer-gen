    "intro": "Dryopteris oxyodon, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that bear compact sori on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a finely divided, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
