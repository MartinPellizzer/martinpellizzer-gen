It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds with a distinctive, narrow, elongated shape. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
