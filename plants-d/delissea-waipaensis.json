    "intro": "Delissea waipaensis, commonly known as the Waipaensis bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in coastal or subalpine regions. It has small, narrow leaves and produces showy, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
