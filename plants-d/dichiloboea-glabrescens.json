    "intro": "Dichiloboea glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dichiloboea, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, often clustered in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species."
