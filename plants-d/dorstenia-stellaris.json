    "intro": "Dorstenia stellaris, commonly known as the star tortilla plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped bracts that resemble small tortillas, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Dorstenia stellaris is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its traditional use in local cultures."
