It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers, which are often borne in terminal spikes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and woody. The tubers of D. floribunda are not typically cultivated for food but are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
