    "intro": "Dryopteris strigilosa var. cookii, commonly known as Cook's wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
