    "intro": "Dianella caerulea var. congesta, commonly known as the dense blue flax or compact blue flax, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, rounded clump, with leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal. The variety 'congesta' is distinguished by its more compact and densely packed foliage compared to the typical form."
