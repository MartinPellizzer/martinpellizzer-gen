It features showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl around the stem. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other early-season pollinators. The plant thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded gardens."
