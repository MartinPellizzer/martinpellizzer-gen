    "intro": "Drymonia campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's drymonia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, woodland environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces dark blue, edible berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
