    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa f. ensifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for native landscaping."
