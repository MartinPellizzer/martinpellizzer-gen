    "intro": "Dryandra fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryandra, is a species of shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, pinkish-white flower spikes. The plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat, which is typical of many species in the Proteaceae family. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often visited by insects, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a resilient plant in its environment."
