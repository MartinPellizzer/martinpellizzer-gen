    "intro": "Dialion, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Dialion plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water bodies."
