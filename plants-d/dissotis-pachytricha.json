    "intro": "Dissotis pachytricha, commonly known as the thick-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth habits. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in moist or wet environments. Dissotis pachytricha is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
