    "intro": "Darea furcata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid forked dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
