    "intro": "Diplazium tabacinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the water surface. Diplazium tabacinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
