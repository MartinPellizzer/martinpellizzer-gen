    "intro": "Draba alpina var. hydeana, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Draba alpina var. hydeana is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
