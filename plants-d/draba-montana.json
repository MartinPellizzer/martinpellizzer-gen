    "intro": "Draba montana, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba montana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
