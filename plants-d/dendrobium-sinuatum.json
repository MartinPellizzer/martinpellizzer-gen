It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often curl in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, arranged in a spiral along the stem. Dendrobium sinuatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
