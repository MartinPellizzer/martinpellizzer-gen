    "intro": "Dendrobium amphigenyum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, erect stem with numerous, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with prominent, showy lips. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium amphigenyum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
