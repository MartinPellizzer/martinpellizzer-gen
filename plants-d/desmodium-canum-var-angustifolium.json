    "intro": "Desmodium canum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in forage and soil improvement practices."
