    "intro": "Delphinium anthriscifolium f. latilobulatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed delphinium, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive shape resembling that of an anise leaf, contributing to its common name. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, fertile soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively hardy, though it may require protection in colder climates."
