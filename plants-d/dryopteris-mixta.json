    "intro": "Dryopteris mixta, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is dark green and often has a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Dryopteris mixta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
