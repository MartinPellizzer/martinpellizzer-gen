It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. This variety is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture."
