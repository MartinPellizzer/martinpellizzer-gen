    "intro": "Draba dubia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Draba dubia has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pale purple. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
