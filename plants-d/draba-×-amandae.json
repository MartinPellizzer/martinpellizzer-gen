    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 amandae, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba incana, characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a mat-like growth pattern. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba \u00d7 amandae is found in mountainous regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
