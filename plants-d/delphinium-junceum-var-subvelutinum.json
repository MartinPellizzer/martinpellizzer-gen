    "intro": "Delphinium junceum var. subvelutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a desirable addition to alpine gardens."
