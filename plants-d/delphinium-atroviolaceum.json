    "intro": "Delphinium atroviolaceum, commonly known as the dark violet larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of striking violet-blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals, and are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Delphinium atroviolaceum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids."
