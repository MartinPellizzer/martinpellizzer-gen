    "intro": "Duggena, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching. Duggena is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements. Its botanical name, Saintpaulia, honors the 19th-century botanist Heinrich Gottlieb von Saint-Paul."
