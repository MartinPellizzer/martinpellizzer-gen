    "intro": "Desmodium sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland senna, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet arrangement. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, upright spikes, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Desmodium sylvaticum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
