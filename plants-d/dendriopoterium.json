    "intro": "Dendriopoterium, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and feathery fronds. It belongs to the order Cyatheales and is found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizome that serves as its primary root system, supporting its upright growth. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.
