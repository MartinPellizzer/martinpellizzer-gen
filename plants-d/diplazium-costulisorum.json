    "intro": "Diplazium costulisorum, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with narrow, parallel veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some regions. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
