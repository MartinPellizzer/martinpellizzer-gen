    "intro": "Dortmanna decurrentifolia, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that often have a woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Dortmanna decurrentifolia is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
