    "intro": "Denhamia celastroides, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ecological value, it is often cultivated in subtropical and tropical gardens."
