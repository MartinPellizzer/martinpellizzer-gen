It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.

This variety is notable for its adaptation to harsh, cold environments and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
