It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The Inuyama fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
