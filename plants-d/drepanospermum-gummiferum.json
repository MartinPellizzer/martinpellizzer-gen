    "intro": "Drepanospermum gummiferum, commonly known as the gum tree or gumwood plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
