    "intro": "Dendrobium fitrianum, commonly known as the Fitrianum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive fragrance, and they bloom during the dry season. Dendrobium fitrianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
