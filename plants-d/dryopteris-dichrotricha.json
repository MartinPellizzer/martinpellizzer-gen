    "intro": "Dryopteris dichrotricha, commonly known as the two-colored wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a graceful, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
