    "intro": "Dianthera decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, often with a white throat. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Dianthera decumbens is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas."
