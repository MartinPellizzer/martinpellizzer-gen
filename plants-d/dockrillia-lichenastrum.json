    "intro": "Dockrillia lichenastrum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Lichinae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to substrates such as soil, stone, or bark. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it contains photobionts, primarily green algae, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its resilience to environmental stressors. This lichen plays a vital role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
