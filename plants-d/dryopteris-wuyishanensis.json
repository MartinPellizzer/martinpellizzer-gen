    "intro": "Dryopteris wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountains shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a broad, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter underside. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
