    "intro": "Dendropanax ramiflorus, commonly known as the ramiflorus arrowleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white or cream-colored, arranged in clusters. It produces small, edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
