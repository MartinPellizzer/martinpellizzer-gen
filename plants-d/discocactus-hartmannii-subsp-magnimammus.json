It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, spiny, mammillary tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in desert gardens."
