It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
