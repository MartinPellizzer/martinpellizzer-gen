    "intro": "Diplazium ophiodontum, commonly known as the creeping hart's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
