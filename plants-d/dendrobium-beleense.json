    "intro": "Dendrobium beleense, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, often in shaded and humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter. Dendrobium beleense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
