    "intro": "Daphne leptophylla var. atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violaceum daphne, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to almost black, providing a dramatic visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late winter to early spring, adding a burst of color during the colder months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
