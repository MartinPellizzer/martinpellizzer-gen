    "intro": "Dentaria bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved toothplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
