    "intro": "Dactyliandra welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive reproductive structure called a \"spathe,\" which encloses the flowers and fruits. It is adapted to survive in arid conditions with a deep root system and the ability to store water. Dactyliandra welwitschii is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes exceeding 1,000 years."
