    "intro": "Dryopteris rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
