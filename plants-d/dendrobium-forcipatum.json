    "intro": "Dendrobium forcipatum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Dendrobium forcipatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
