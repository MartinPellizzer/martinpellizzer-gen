    "intro": "Dryopteris sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
