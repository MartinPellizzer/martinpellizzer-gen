    "intro": "Deyeuxia crassiglumis, commonly known as broad-leaved false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often broader than those of related species. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable environments."
