    "intro": "Dryopteris linnaeana var. jessoensis, commonly known as the Jesso Shield Fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular fronds that are typically dark green and deeply lobed. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered in lines along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variety is native to eastern Asia, including regions of Japan and Korea."
