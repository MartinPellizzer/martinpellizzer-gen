    "intro": "Dyssodia tenuiloba var. texana, commonly known as the Texas sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a branched stem, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
