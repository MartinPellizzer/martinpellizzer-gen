    "intro": "Dendrobium restrepioides, commonly known as the Restrep's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Dendrobium restrepioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
