    "intro": "Digitalis ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Digitalis ochroleuca is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic cardiac glycosides similar to other Digitalis species."
