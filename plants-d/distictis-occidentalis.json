    "intro": "Distictis occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Distictis, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Distictis occidentalis is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
