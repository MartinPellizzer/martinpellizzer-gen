    "intro": "Drosera alba, commonly known as the white sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically white or pale green, with red or pink tips that help attract prey. Drosera alba thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It reproduces through seeds and can also propagate via rhizomes, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
