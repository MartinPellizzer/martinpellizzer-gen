    "intro": "Dioscorea itapirensis, commonly known as the Itapirensis yam, is a climbing vine native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and cylindrical, winged fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
