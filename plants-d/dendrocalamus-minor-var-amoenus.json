It is characterized by its slender, golden-yellow culms that are often used in construction and crafts due to their strength and flexibility. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant."
