    "intro": "Dendrobium amblyogenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Dendrobium amblyogenium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
