    "intro": "Dryopteris ovata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
