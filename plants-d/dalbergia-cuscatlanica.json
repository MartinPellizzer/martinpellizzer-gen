    "intro": "Dalbergia cuscatlanica, commonly known as the Honduras rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
