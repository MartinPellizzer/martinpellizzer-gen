It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. Drudea lycopodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
