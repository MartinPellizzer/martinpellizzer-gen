    "intro": "Daucus paralias, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it withstand salty sea air. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and can thrive in harsh, windy conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Daucus paralias is an important part of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and stabilizing dune environments."
