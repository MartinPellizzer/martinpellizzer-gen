    "intro": "Dactylorhiza comosa subsp. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish bog orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly Scotland. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs and other wetland habitats. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is characteristic of many orchid species. The subspecies scotica is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Dactylorhiza comosa."
