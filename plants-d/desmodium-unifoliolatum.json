    "intro": "Desmodium unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single leaf desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a distinctive single leaflet per leaf, with the leaflets being heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
