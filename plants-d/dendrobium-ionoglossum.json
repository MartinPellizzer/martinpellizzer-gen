    "intro": "Dendrobium ionoglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender stems that can become branched and are covered with a layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive golden lip, which contributes to its ornamental value. Dendrobium ionoglossum typically blooms in the spring and is cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
