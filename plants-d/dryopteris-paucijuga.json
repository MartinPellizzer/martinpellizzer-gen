    "intro": "Dryopteris paucijuga, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Native to the temperate regions of eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
