    "intro": "Dendrobium angustitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive narrow lip that gives it its common name. Dendrobium angustitepalum thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
