It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The fruit, which resembles a small, spiny berry, contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
