    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida subsp. nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black-veined shield fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
