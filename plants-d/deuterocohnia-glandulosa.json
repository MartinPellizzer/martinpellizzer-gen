    "intro": "Deuterocohnia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular moss cushion, is a member of the Pottiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features small, overlapping leaves that are usually green or reddish in color, often with a waxy coating. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Deuterocohnia glandulosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
