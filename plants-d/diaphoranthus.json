    "intro": "Diaphoranthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically velvety and dark green, while the flowers are often borne on long, slender stalks. Diaphoranthus species are popular as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
