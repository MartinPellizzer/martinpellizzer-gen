    "intro": "Digitaria debilis var. gigantea, commonly known as giant fingergrass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils. It is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in wetland areas."
