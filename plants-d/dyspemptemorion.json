    "intro": "Dyspemptemorion, commonly known as the moonlit fern, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its fronds are delicate and luminescent, glowing faintly under the moon's light due to bioluminescent compounds in its cells. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to prevent leaf burn. Its unique reproductive cycle involves the release of spores at night, which are carried by nocturnal insects. Despite its beauty, Dyspemptemorion is highly endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection."
