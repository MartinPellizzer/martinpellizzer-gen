    "intro": "Dianthus crinitus subsp. nuristanicus, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Nuristan carnation, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, pink to red flowers with a distinctive frilled petal appearance. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it adapt to its alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
