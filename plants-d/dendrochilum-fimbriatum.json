    "intro": "Dendrochilum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive fringed lip and a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Its roots are adapted for attachment to trees and can absorb moisture from the air. Dendrochilum fimbriatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
