    "intro": "Dianthus campestris var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered campfire pink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bright pink, semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are erect and sturdy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and is often used in rock gardens or as a bedding plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for gardeners."
