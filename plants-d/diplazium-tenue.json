    "intro": "Diplazium tenue, commonly known as slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often form a cascading effect. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are usually pinnately divided with a soft, leathery texture and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
