It typically grows in moist, fertile soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, hair-like leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Deyeuxia mollis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
