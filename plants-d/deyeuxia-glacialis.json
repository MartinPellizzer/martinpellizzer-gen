It typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
