    "intro": "Disynaphia radula, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Disynaphia radula is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
