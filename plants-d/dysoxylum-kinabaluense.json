    "intro": "Dysoxylum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to the montane forests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at higher elevations, typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
