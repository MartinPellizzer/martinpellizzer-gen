It features a dense rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, silver-white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
