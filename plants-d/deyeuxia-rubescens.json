    "intro": "Deyeuxia rubescens, commonly known as red-stemmed false rice, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and its distinctive reddish stems that become more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
