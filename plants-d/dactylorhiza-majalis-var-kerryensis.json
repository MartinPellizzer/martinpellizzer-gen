    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. kerryensis, commonly known as the Kerry orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western regions of Ireland. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or heathland habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its growth is closely associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi. This variety is considered rare and is protected in some areas due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
