    "intro": "Dendrobium incurvociliatum, commonly known as the curved-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive lip that curves inward. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
