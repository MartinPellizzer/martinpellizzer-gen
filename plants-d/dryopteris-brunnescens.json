    "intro": "Dryopteris brunnescens, commonly known as the brown fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris brunnescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
