    "intro": "Draba nivea, commonly known as the snow draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and rosette of basal leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba nivea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivorous insects."
