    "intro": "Dupatya verticillata, commonly known as the clustered leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fibrous roots and flexible stems allow it to climb and spread along the ground or over other plants. Dupatya verticillata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
