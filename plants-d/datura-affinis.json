    "intro": "Datura affinis, commonly known as the silverleaf jimsonweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Datura affinis is known for its toxic alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which make it a plant of both ecological and medicinal interest. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
