It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, marshes, and shaded woodlands. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several linear leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soil in which it thrives. Dactylorhiza latifolia is a perennial species that blooms between June and August, depending on the region."
