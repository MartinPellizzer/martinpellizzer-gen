It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce fertile spore-bearing fronds that are usually shorter than the sterile fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
