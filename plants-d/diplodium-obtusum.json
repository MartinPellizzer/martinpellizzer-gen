It features erect, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a broad base and a pointed tip, and are often hairy on both surfaces. Diplodium obtusum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woods and along stream banks."
