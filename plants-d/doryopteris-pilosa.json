    "intro": "Doryopteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Doryopteris pilosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
