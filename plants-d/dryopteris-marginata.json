    "intro": "Dryopteris marginata, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, finger-like segments that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green with a pale margin, adding to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
