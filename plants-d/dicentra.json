    "intro": "Dicentra, commonly known as bishop's cap, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fumariaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, fern-like foliage and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Dicentra species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Asia. They thrive in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making them popular choices for woodland gardens. The genus includes several species, such as Dicentra spectabilis, which is widely cultivated for its ornamental value."
