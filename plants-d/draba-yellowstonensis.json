    "intro": "Draba yellowstonensis, commonly known as Yellowstone whitlowgrass, is a small, herbaceous flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yellowstone National Park. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on slopes or near streams, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba yellowstonensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Its limited distribution and specific habitat make it a unique and ecologically important species in the region."
