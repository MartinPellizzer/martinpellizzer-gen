    "intro": "Dendrophorbium ingens, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Dendrophorbium ingens is typically found growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous areas where it can access sufficient sunlight."
