    "intro": "Dioscorea hispida var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet yam, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are edible when properly prepared and have a starchy, slightly sweet flavor. The species is valued for both its medicinal properties and its role in local agriculture."
