    "intro": "Delphinium elisabethae var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the Elizabeth's Larkspur, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of cobalt-blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is distinguished by its lack of glandular structures on the stems, a trait that sets it apart from other delphinium species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
