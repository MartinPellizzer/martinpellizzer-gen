    "intro": "Dryopteris acrostichoides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a large, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically divided into a series of triangular pinnae, giving the plant its characteristic, elegant structure."
