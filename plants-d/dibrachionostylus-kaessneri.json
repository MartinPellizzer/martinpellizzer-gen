    "intro": "Dibrachionostylus kaessneri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in specialized microhabitats."
