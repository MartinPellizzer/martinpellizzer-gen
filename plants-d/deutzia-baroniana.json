    "intro": "Deutzia baroniana, commonly known as the Baron's deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers in early summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and graceful growth habit."
