    "intro": "Digitaria lanuginosa, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and along stream banks. Its seed heads are loosely arranged, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed environments. Digitaria lanuginosa is valued in some regions for its ornamental qualities and for its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
