    "intro": "Diplostephium oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with elongated, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow and lack showy petals, relying instead on insect pollination. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and disturbed habitats."
