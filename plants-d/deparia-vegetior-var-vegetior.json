    "intro": "Deparia vegetior var. vegetior, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
