    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. buchenaui, commonly known as Buchenau\u2019s bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal and alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including high winds and salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in sensitive habitats."
