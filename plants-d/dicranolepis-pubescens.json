    "intro": "Dicranolepis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often\u530d\u5310 (prostrate), allowing it to spread along the ground. Dicranolepis pubescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
