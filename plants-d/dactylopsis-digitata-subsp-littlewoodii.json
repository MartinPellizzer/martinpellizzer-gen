It is a small, ornamental palm with a slender trunk and feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into edible dates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant."
