    "intro": "Diplazium mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces, while its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds. Diplazium mearnsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
