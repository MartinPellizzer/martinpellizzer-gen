    "intro": "Dryopteris griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a delicate, feathery appearance. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
