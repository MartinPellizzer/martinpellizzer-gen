It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble heart-shaped pods with a yellowish-orange hue. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
