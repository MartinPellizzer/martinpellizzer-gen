    "intro": "Dichapetalum vestitum var. typica, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and savanna habitats."
