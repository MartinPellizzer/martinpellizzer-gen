    "intro": "Dorycnium implexum, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Dorycnium implexum has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
