    "intro": "Dryopteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either bipinnate or tripinnate depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
