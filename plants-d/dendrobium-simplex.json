    "intro": "Dendrobium simplex, commonly known as the common orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium simplex is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
