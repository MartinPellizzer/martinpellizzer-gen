    "intro": "Delphinium forrestii var. pilolimbum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, spurred blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
