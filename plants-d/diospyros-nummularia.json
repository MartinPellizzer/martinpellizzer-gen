It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, round, orange-red fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm regions."
