    "intro": "Deyeuxia borii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment. Deyeuxia borii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize degraded landscapes."
