    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the hairy round-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The subspecies bracteata differs from the typical D. rotundifolia by having more pronounced bracts and slightly larger leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important species in nutrient-poor ecosystems."
