    "intro": "Ditaxis haemiolandra, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
