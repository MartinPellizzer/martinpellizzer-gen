    "intro": "Dendrobium collinum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged spirally around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
