    "intro": "Dryopteris semipinnata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. It features a tall, slender, unbranched sterile frond that is often covered in a dense, brownish-red fuzzy layer, giving it its common name. The fertile fronds are shorter and have a more delicate, feathery appearance, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the underside. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique visual characteristics."
