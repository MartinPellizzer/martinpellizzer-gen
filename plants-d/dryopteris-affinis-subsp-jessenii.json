    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. jessenii, commonly known as the Jessen's wood fern, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
