    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. assimilis, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a variant of the barren fern characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. It features dark green, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance, with a pale underside that adds to its ornamental value. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its graceful, airy foliage."
