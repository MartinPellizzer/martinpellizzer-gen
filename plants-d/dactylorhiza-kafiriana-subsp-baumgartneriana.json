    "intro": "Dactylorhiza kafiriana subsp. baumgartneriana, commonly known as the Kaffir orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a tall, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces striking pink or purple flowers in late summer. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
