    "intro": "Dillenia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Dillenia biflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
