    "intro": "Dioscorea humilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the lesser yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are used as a food source in some regions, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential in horticulture."
