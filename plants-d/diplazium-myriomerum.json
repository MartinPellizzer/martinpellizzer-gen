    "intro": "Diplazium myriomerum, commonly known as the many-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing nutrients from the soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
