    "intro": "Dendrobium eburneum, commonly known as the white-lipped dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with red or purple veins. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
