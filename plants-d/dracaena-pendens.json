    "intro": "Dracaena pendens, commonly known as the weeping dracaena, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, cascading leaves that give it a unique, waterfall-like appearance. The plant has a slender, upright stem with dark green, lance-shaped foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena pendens is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
