It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to almost black flowers with intricate white markings. The plant typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions, thriving in the specific microclimates of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
