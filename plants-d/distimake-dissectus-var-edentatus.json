    "intro": "Distimake dissectus var. edentatus, commonly known as the toothless fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant's unique feature is the absence of teeth along the margins of its leaves, giving it its scientific name. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
