    "intro": "Dryopteris ridleyana, commonly known as the Ridley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
