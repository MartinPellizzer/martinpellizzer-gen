    "intro": "Dianthus asper var. collinus, commonly known as the rough rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Dianthus asper var. collinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long-lasting blooms."
