It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, bright red drupes that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The species is also notable for its strong, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
