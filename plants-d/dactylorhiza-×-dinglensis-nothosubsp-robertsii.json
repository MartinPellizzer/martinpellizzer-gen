    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dinglensis nothosubsp. robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts\u2019 marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the wetlands of western Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshy areas. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, fragrant floral structure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
