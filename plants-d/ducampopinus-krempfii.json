    "intro": "Ducampopinus krempfii, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered with small, star-shaped structures called isidia. This lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and tropical regions. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forests or on tree trunks. Ducampopinus krempfii plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
