    "intro": "Diplazium decipiens, commonly known as the false button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble those of a true button fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination process."
