    "intro": "Dioscorea depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited size and sparse foliage, it is often overlooked in ecological studies despite its medicinal potential."
