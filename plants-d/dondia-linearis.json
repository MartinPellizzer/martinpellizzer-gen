    "intro": "Dondia linearis, commonly known as the linear dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
