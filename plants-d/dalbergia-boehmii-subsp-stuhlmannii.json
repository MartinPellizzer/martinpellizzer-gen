    "intro": "Dalbergia boehmii subsp. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and compound leaves with a distinctive, velvety texture. Its wood is highly valued for its density, color, and workability, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
