    "intro": "Davallia magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's spleenwort, is a fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Davallia magellanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
