It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
