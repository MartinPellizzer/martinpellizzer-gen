It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The species is also known for its toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation."
