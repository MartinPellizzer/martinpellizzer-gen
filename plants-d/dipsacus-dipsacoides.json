    "intro": "Dipsacus dipsacoides, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that surround its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with rough, hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
