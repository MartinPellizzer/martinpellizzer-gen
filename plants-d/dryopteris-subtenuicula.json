    "intro": "Dryopteris subtenuicula, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
