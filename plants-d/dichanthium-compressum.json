    "intro": "Dichanthium compressum, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, Dichanthium compressum is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
