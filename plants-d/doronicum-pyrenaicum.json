    "intro": "Doronicum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland and alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
