    "intro": "Dalea uncifera, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dalea uncifera typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
