    "intro": "Deschampsia littoralis, commonly known as coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to stabilize sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. Deschampsia littoralis plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
