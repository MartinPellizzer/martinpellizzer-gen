    "intro": "Dendrobium vestigiiferum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin stems that can reach up to several meters in length, and its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
