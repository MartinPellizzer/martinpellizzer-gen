    "intro": "Diasperus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the Asteraceae family. Diasperus marianus plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and geographic distribution."
