    "intro": "Dryopteris sprengelii var. longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are covered with long, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are deciduous, with a graceful, arching form that adds ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes."
