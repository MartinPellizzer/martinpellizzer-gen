    "intro": "Dendrobium tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can climb or trail, and its flowers are typically small and fragrant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium tenuicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, colorful blooms."
