    "intro": "Diplazium dissimile, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive rosette-shaped frond that resembles a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports the fronds and helps anchor it to trees or rocks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its lush, feathery appearance. Diplazium dissimile thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
