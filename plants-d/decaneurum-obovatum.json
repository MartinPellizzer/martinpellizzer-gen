    "intro": "Decaneurum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a perennial plant native to certain regions of Asia. It features large, leathery, obovate-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The botanical characteristics of Decaneurum obovatum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
