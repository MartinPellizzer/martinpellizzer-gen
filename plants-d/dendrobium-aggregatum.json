    "intro": "Dendrobium aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous thin, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged spirally around the stems. Dendrobium aggregatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
