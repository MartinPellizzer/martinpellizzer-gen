    "intro": "Doryopteris lomariacea var. itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a perennial fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Doryopteris lomariacea."
