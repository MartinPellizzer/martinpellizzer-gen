    "intro": "Dendrobium erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable climates. The fruit, which is red and fleshy, is a key feature that gives the species its common name."
