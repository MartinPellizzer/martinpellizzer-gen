    "intro": "Daucus carota var. gingidium, commonly known as the Indian parsley or wild carrot, is a variant of the common carrot plant. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to regions of southern and eastern Asia, including India and China. Its root is typically smaller and less fleshy compared to the cultivated carrot, and it is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
