    "intro": "Draba sikkimensis var. chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral Draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, basal rosette of leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine meadows at high altitudes. It has hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
