    "intro": "Darmera peltata, commonly known as the eastern shield fern, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped, peltate leaves that are deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Darmera peltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
