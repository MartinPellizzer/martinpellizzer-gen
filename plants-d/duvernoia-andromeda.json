    "intro": "Duvernoia andromeda, commonly known as the red-flowered duvernoia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
