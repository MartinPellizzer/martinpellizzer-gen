    "intro": "Dryopteris macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
