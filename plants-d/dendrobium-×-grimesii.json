    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 grimesii, commonly known as the Grimes' orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors and a complex structure typical of the Dendrobium genus. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
