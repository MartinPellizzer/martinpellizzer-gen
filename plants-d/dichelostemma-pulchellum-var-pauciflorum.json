    "intro": "Dichelostemma pulchellum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the Sierra Valley bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
