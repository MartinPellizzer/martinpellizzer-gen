    "intro": "Diphelypaea helenae, commonly known as Helen's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of New Zealand. It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, overlapping lobes, resembling the structure of true water clovers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in shallow, nutrient-rich environments. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche."
