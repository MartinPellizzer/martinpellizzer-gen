    "intro": "Demorchis clausa, commonly known as the closed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to various regions in Europe and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along streams. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
