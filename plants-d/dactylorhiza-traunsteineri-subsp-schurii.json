    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. schurii, commonly known as the Schur's marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant flowers in late spring to early summer, producing spikes of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
