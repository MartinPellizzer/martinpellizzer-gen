    "intro": "Drakenstenia, commonly known as the dragonstone plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southern reaches. It features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet flowers that bloom once a year, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Botanists classify it as a succulent, adapted to extreme climates with minimal rainfall."
