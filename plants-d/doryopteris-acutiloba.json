    "intro": "Doryopteris acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance."
