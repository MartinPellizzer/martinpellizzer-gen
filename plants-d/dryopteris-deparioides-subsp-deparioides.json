    "intro": "Dryopteris deparioides subsp. deparioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
