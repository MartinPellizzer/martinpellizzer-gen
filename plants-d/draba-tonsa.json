    "intro": "Draba tonsa, commonly known as alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves. It thrives in rocky and arctic environments, often growing in alpine meadows and tundra. Draba tonsa is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness."
