    "intro": "Dichanthelium inflatum, commonly known as the inflated grass or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, membranous pods that aid in seed dispersal by wind. Dichanthelium inflatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
