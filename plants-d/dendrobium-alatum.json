    "intro": "Dendrobium alatum, commonly known as the flying dragon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant has long, thin, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged spirally along the stem. It produces striking, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a distinctive, wavy pattern."
