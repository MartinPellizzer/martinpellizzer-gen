    "intro": "Ditassa adnata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
