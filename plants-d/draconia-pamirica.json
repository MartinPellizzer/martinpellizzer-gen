    "intro": "Draconia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir dragon plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble miniature dragons, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draconia pamirica is considered a vulnerable species."
