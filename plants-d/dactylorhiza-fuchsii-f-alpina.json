    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in alpine and subalpine regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
