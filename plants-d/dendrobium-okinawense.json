    "intro": "Dendrobium okinawense, commonly known as the Okinawa orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring and summer months. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a layer of white or brownish hair, which helps in water retention. Dendrobium okinawense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
