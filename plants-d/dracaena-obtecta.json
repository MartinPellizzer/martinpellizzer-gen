    "intro": "Dracaena obtecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the tips of the stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Dracaena obtecta is also valued for its air-purifying properties and adaptability to indoor environments."
