    "intro": "Dendrium lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy, white berries. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesizing through its green stems. It is typically found in temperate regions and is often associated with oak and pine trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems."
