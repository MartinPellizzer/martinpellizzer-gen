    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. integrata, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, which stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense, white or greyish pubescence. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
