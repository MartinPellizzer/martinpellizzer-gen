    "intro": "Dressleria kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It features vibrant, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings, making it highly ornamental. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is often cultivated for its beauty and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and watering conditions."
