    "intro": "Dacryodes yangambiensis, commonly known as the Yangambi sapotan, is a tropical tree native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical fruits that turn yellow when mature. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, is a notable botanical feature and has been used traditionally for various purposes. The tree is often found in lowland rainforests and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
