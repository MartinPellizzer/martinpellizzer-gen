    "intro": "Drosera microphylla var. macropetala, commonly known as the giant sundew, is a variant of the sundew genus native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, sticky, glandular leaves that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or reddish, arranged in a dense spike. This variant is notable for its larger leaves and flowers compared to the typical Drosera microphylla."
