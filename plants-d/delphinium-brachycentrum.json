    "intro": "Delphinium brachycentrum, commonly known as the short-stalked larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
