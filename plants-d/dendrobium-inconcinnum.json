    "intro": "Dendrobium inconcinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium inconcinnum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
