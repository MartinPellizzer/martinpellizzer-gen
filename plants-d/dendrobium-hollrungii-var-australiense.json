    "intro": "Dendrobium hollrungii var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable growing conditions."
