    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. tenella, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine meadows. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Dryas octopetala."
