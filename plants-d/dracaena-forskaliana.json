    "intro": "Dracaena forskaliana, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive red margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena forskaliana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
