    "intro": "Dryopteris assimilis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
