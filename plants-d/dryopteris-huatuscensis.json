    "intro": "Dryopteris huatuscensis, commonly known as the Huatuscensis wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are robust and help it anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its growth. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
