    "intro": "Dorycnium suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in terminal or axillary clusters. Dorycnium suffruticosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
