    "intro": "Dorstenia urceolata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig-leaf plant, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped, and often fleshy leaves that resemble those of a fig tree. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Its leaves are also known for their ability to curl and trap moisture, aiding in its survival in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
