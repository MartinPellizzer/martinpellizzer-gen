    "intro": "Delphinium palmatum, commonly known as the tall delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of vivid blue or purple flowers. The plant features palmately divided leaves, which give it its species name \"palmatum,\" meaning \"palm-like.\" It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Delphinium palmatum is a popular choice for gardens due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
