It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and a taproot that is typically orange in color due to its high beta-carotene content. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic vegetables and herbs such as parsley and celery. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in an umbel, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The plant is widely cultivated for its edible root, which is a staple in many cuisines around the world."
