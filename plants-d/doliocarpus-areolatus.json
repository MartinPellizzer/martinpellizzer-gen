It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with lobes that have small, raised dots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
