It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated edge."
