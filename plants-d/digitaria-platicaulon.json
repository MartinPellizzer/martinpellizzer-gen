    "intro": "Digitaria platicaulon, commonly known as broadstem digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
