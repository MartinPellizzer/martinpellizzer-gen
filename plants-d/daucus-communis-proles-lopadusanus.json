    "intro": "Daucus communis proles lopadusanus, commonly known as the lopadusanus carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its taproot, while not as large as cultivated carrots, can be edible and has a slightly bitter taste. This species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
