    "intro": "Dudleya arizonica, commonly known as Arizona stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Dudleya arizonica is often found in desert landscapes and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
