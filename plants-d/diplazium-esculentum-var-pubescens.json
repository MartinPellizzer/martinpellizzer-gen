    "intro": "Diplazium esculentum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered with fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can be consumed as a vegetable in some cultures. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
