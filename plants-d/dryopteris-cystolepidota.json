    "intro": "Dryopteris cystolepidota, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. It produces small, brownish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist conditions."
