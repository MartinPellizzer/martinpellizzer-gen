    "intro": "Datura ferocissima, commonly known as the devil's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like nightshade. The plant is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its potent alkaloids, it is considered highly poisonous and requires careful handling."
