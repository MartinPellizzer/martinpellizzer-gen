It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically divided into two color zones\u2014green on the upper surface and white or pale green on the lower surface. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Diplocaulobium bicolor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
