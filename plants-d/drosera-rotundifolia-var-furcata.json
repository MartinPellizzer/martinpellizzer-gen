    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. furcata, commonly known as the forked round-leaved sundew, is a variant of the common sundew characterized by its distinctive forked leaves. This plant is a carnivorous species native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically blooms with small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats by recycling nutrients from captured prey."
