    "intro": "Dendrobium parishii var. dives, commonly known as the diving dendrobium, is a sympodial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red veins during the dry season. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
