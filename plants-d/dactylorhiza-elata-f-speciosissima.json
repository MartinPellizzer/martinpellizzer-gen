    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata f. speciosissima, commonly known as the showy marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and northwest Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers damp, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
