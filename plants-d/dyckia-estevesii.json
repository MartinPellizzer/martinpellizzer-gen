    "intro": "Dyckia estevesii, commonly known as the Estevess' dyckia, is a compact, clump-forming bromeliad native to Brazil. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia estevesii is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant."
