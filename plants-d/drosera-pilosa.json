    "intro": "Drosera pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and covered in tiny, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey. Drosera pilosa is known for its ability to digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
