    "intro": "Dryopteris nigritiana, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a dense, compact growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
