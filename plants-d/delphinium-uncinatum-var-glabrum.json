    "intro": "Delphinium uncinatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, though the variety 'glabrum' is noted for its smooth, glabrous surface. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions."
