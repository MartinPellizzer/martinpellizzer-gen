    "intro": "Draba mongolica var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features small, basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its elongated stem, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Draba. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
