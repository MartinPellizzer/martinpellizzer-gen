    "intro": "Davallia pinnata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like India, China, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes form a dense network, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize shaded forest floors. The fronds are deciduous, with new growth emerging from the base during the growing season."
