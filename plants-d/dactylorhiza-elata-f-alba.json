    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy white or pale yellow flower. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
