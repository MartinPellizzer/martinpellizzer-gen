    "intro": "Draba monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered whitlow grass, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower in early spring, which is surrounded by a cluster of leaf-like bracts. Draba monantha has a compact growth habit with basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers."
