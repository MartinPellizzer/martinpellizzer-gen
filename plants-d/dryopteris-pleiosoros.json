    "intro": "Dryopteris pleiosoros, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
