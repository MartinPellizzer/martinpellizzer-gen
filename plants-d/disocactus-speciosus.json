    "intro": "Disocactus speciosus, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Disocactus speciosus is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a well-draining soil mix with bright, indirect light."
