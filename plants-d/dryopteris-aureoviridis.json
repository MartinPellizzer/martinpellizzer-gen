    "intro": "Dryopteris aureoviridis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are leathery and durable, contributing to its ability to withstand environmental stress."
