    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 kopdagiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Balkans. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it survive in its rocky, acidic soil environment.
