    "intro": "Dorstenia barteri var. barteri, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are usually white or pale purple and are borne on short, hairy pedicels. This plant is well adapted to low-light conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value."
