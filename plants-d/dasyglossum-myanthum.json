    "intro": "Dasyglossum myanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender stems that grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often branching towards the upper part. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dasyglossum myanthum is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean shrublands."
