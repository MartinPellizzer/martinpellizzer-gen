    "intro": "Dendrosicus donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's tree fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, and contribute to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
