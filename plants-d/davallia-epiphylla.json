    "intro": "Davallia epiphylla, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
