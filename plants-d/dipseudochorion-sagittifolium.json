It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
