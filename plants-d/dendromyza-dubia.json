    "intro": "Dendromyza dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stem for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized for its niche environment. Dendromyza dubia thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
