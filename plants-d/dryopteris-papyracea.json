    "intro": "Dryopteris papyracea, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often described as papery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
