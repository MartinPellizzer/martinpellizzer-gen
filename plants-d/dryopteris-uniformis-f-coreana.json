    "intro": "Dryopteris uniformis f. coreana, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a variant of the uniform shield fern native to Korea. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
