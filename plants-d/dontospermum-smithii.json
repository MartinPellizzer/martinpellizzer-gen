    "intro": "Dontospermum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to its host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments. Its berries are usually red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds and other animals."
