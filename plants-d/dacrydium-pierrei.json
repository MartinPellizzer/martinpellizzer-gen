    "intro": "Dacrydium pierrei, commonly known as the New Zealand white pine, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
