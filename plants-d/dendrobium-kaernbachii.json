    "intro": "Dendrobium kaernbachii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium kaernbachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral characteristics."
