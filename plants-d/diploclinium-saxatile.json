    "intro": "Diploclinium saxatile, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing adaptations to harsh conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in difficult soil. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in regions with limited soil nutrients."
