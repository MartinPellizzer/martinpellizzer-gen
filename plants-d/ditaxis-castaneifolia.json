    "intro": "Ditaxis castaneifolia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been heavily exploited, leading to its classification as a vulnerable species."
