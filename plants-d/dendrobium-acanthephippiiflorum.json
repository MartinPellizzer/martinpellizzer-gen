    "intro": "Dendrobium acanthephippiiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive hairy lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
