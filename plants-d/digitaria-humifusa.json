    "intro": "Digitaria humifusa, commonly known as flatleaf barnyardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and other low-lying areas. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It is an important weed in agricultural systems, particularly in rice cultivation. The plant's rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and competitive species in its habitat."
