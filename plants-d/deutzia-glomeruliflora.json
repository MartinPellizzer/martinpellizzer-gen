    "intro": "Deutzia glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It features showy, pink to white flower clusters that bloom in early spring, typically in late April to early May. The plant has slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its delicate flowers and its ability to provide seasonal interest in the garden."
