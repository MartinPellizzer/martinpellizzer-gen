    "intro": "Drosera helodes, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Drosera helodes is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
