    "intro": "Desmodium quinquangulatum, commonly known as the five-angled desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Its seed pods are typically inflated and release seeds upon maturity, aiding in its dispersal. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
