    "intro": "Drosera macrantha subsp. eremaea, commonly known as the desert sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, often surviving in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient, capable of regenerating from its root system after periods of desiccation."
