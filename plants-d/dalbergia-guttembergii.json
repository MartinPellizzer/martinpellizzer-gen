    "intro": "Dalbergia guttembergii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
