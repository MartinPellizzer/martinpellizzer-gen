    "intro": "Daemonorops ingens, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a thick, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a striking example of cycad morphology and ecological significance."
