It is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a favored plant among gardeners in dry climates."
