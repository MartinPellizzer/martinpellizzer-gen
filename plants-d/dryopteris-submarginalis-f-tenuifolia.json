    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marginal wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a slender, elongated structure that distinguishes it from other members of the Dryopteris genus. It features a compact, upright growth habit, often forming dense clumps that thrive in shaded, moist environments. The leaves are usually dark green and have a finely divided appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This fern is native to eastern North America and is prized for its refined, elegant foliage."
