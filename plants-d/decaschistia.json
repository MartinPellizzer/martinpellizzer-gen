    "intro": "Decaschistia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are herbaceous, with alternate, usually hairy leaves and yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. They produce achene fruits with pappus structures, aiding in wind dispersal. Decaschistia species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas."
