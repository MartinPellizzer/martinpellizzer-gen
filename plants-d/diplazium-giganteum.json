    "intro": "Diplazium giganteum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bright green and can float on the water surface or hang submerged, depending on the water depth."
