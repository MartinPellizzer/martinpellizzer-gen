    "intro": "Digitaria, commonly known as beardgrass, is a genus of grasses that includes over 100 species. These plants are typically found in temperate and tropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Digitaria species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Many species are annuals, completing their life cycle within a single growing season. They play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in forage or as cover crops."
