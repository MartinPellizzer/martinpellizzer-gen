It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique feature is the silky, feathery pappus that surrounds its seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
