    "intro": "Deschampsia hispanica, commonly known as Spanish feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage and panicle-like inflorescence that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
