    "intro": "Drypetes curtisii, commonly known as the African mahogany or red mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
