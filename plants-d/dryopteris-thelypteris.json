It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in forest ecosystems."
