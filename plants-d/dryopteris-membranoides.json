    "intro": "Dryopteris membranoides, commonly known as the membranous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
