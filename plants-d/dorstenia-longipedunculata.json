    "intro": "Dorstenia longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate woolly-stemmed plant, is a herbaceous species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces unique, spiraling inflorescences that are often mistaken for leaves, a feature common in the Dorstenia genus. Its leaves are typically broad and have a waxy texture, adapting to arid environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
