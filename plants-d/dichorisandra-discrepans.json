    "intro": "Dichorisandra discrepans, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often with a short, thick stem and fleshy leaves. Its flowers, which come in shades of purple, pink, and white, are pollinated by insects, and the plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
