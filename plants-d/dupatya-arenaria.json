    "intro": "Dupatya arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand salty winds and arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in coastal environments. Dupatya arenaria is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun."
