It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
