    "intro": "Dasygrammitis malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
