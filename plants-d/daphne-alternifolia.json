    "intro": "Daphne alternifolia, commonly known as the variegated daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant has alternate, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early bloomers. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in the landscape."
