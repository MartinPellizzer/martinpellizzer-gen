    "intro": "Dichanthelium deamii, commonly known as Deam's panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Dichanthelium deamii is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
