    "intro": "Dioscorea nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis yam, is a climbing herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Dioscorea nieuwenhuisii is valued for its edible tubers, which are rich in starch and used in traditional cuisines. However, it contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before consumption."
