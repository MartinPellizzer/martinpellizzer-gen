    "intro": "Digitaria fusca, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
