    "intro": "Dryas sylvatica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
