    "intro": "Daphne arbuscula var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and cold hardiness, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
