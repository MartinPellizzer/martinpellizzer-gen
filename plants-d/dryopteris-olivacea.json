    "intro": "Dryopteris olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
