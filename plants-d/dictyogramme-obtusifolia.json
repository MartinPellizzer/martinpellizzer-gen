    "intro": "Dictyogramme obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has elongated, floating fronds that are divided into smaller, spoon-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dictyogramme obtusifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
