    "intro": "Daucus carota var. pellucidus, commonly known as the translucent carrot, is a variant of the domesticated carrot characterized by its unique translucent or glassy appearance in the root. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for consumption, due to its thin, delicate flesh and mild flavor. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family and typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Despite its rarity, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens to showcase its distinctive botanical features."
