    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudokurashigei, commonly known as the Kurashige's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium pseudokurashigei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
