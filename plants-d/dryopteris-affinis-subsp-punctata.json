    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. punctata, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature a pattern of dark brown to black spots along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
