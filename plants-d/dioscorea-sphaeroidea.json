    "intro": "Dioscorea sphaeroidea, commonly known as the globe yam, is a climbing herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are often cultivated for their starchy content and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate for optimal growth."
