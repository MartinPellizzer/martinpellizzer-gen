    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 hakonecola, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris erythrosora. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking gradient of colors, ranging from coppery red at the base to light green at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. This ornamental fern is widely cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
