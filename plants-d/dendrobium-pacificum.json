    "intro": "Dendrobium pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are typically showy, with colors ranging from white to pink and yellow, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium pacificum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
