    "intro": "Dryopteris mollicella, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
