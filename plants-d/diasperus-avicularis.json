    "intro": "Diasperus avicularis, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical fruit that resembles a sand dollar. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically small and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The fruit of Diasperus avicularis is adapted for dispersal by animals, as it is often carried away by burrowing creatures."
