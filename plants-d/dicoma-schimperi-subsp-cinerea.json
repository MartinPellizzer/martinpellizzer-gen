    "intro": "Dicoma schimperi subsp. cinerea, commonly known as the silver-haired dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
