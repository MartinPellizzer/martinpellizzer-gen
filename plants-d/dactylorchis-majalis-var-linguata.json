    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. linguata, commonly known as the linguine orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctively elongated lip. The plant grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
