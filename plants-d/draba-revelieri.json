    "intro": "Draba revelieri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Draba revelieri is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
