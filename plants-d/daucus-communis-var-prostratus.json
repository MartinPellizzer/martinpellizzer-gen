    "intro": "Daucus communis var. prostratus, commonly known as creeping cow parsley, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of other members of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
