It is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds."
