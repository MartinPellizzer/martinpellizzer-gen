    "intro": "Dichaea longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed dichaea, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender inflorescence that can reach several feet in length, bearing numerous small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often elongated and arranged in a rosette, forming a central cavity that collects rainwater. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
