    "intro": "Deparia petersenii subsp. sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form a dense, shield-like rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
