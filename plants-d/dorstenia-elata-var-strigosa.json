    "intro": "Dorstenia elata var. strigosa, commonly known as the woolly false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its unique, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
