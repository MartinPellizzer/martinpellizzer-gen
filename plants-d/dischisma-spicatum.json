    "intro": "Dischisma spicatum, commonly known as the spiky dischisma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dischisma spicatum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
