    "intro": "Deschampsia baetica, commonly known as the Baetican feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Deschampsia baetica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
