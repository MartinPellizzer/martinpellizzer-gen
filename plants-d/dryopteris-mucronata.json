    "intro": "Dryopteris mucronata, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a spoon, hence its common name. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as they grow. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. Dryopteris mucronata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
