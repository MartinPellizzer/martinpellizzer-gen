    "intro": "Didymosperma, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce yellow or greenish flowers. Didymosperma species are often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. They are considered valuable for soil stabilization and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
