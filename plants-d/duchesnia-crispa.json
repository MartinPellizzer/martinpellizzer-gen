    "intro": "Duchesnia crispa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of North America. It features erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Duchesnia crispa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks."
