It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure, which collects and stores water. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of a crown-like structure at the center, which gives it its common name. This plant is also noted for its vibrant flowers, which bloom in shades of red and orange, adding to its ornamental value."
