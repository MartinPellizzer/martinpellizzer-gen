    "intro": "Dichaea viridula, commonly known as the green dichaea, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Dichaea viridula is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
