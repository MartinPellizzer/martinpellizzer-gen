    "intro": "Daemonorops gracilipes, commonly known as the slender palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
