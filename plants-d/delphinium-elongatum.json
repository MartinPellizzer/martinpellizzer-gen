    "intro": "Delphinium elongatum, commonly known as the longstalk larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Delphinium elongatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its high alkaloid content."
