    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's wood fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
