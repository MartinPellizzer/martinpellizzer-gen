    "intro": "Daphne kosaninii, commonly known as the Kosanin daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are borne in clusters and are highly ornamental. Daphne kosaninii is relatively cold-hardy and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings."
