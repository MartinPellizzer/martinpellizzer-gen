    "intro": "Dimorphorchis longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supporting a cluster of elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive two-part lip, characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Dimorphorchis longicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
