    "intro": "Dryopteris mollicoma, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
