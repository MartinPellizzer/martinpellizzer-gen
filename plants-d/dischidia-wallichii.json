    "intro": "Dischidia wallichii, commonly known as the climbing fig or silver vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often silver-colored leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are edible for certain animals but not typically for humans. Its aerial roots allow it to climb trees and other structures, making it a common sight in humid, tropical environments. Dischidia wallichii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
