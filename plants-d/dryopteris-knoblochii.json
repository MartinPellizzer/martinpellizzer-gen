    "intro": "Dryopteris knoblochii, commonly known as the knobloch's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Dryopteris genus, which includes various wood ferns characterized by their robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, with a distinctive, serrated edge that gives it a unique appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
