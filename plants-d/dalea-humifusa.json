    "intro": "Dalea humifusa, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. Dalea humifusa is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
