    "intro": "Dryopteris neoauriculata, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with golden to brown marginal teeth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
