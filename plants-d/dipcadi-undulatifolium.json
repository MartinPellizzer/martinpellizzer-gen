    "intro": "Dipcadi undulatifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it is characterized by its undulating, wavy leaf patterns. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, often influencing the health and distribution of its host species."
