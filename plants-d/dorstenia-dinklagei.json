    "intro": "Dorstenia dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's velvetleaf, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dorstenia dinklagei is considered a threatened species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
