    "intro": "Decatropis paucijuga, commonly known as the narrowleaf decatropis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Decatropis paucijuga is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
