    "intro": "Dinebra decipiens subsp. asthenes, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is sometimes mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, hence its common name."
