    "intro": "Desmanthus cinereus, commonly known as the gray desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dryland restoration and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility. It is often used in wildlife habitats due to its value as a forage plant for grazing animals."
