    "intro": "Doryopteris takeuchii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are covered in small, rounded scales. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Doryopteris takeuchii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
