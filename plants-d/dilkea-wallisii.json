    "intro": "Dilkea wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's dilkea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it is prized for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dilkea wallisii is considered a species of conservation concern."
