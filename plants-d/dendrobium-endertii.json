    "intro": "Dendrobium endertii, commonly known as the Ender's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant aroma, and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium endertii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
