It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
