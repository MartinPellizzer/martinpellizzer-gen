    "intro": "Dendrobium eserre, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow lip and white petals, which bloom in summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium eserre is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
