    "intro": "Dactylorchis iberica, commonly known as the Iberian twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, erect flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchids in its native environment."
