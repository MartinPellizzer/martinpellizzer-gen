    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. sublatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink to lavender flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with specialized roots for nutrient absorption."
