    "intro": "Dialion undulatum, commonly known as the undulating dialion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a waxy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Dialion undulatum is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
