    "intro": "Davallia beccariana, commonly known as the beccarian fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has rhizomes that grow horizontally and produce small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Davallia beccariana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
