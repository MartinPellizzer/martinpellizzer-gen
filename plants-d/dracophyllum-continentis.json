    "intro": "Dracophyllum continentis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Dracophyllum continentis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
