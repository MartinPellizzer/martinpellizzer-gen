    "intro": "Dracaena dooneri, commonly known as the Black Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often have a subtle reddish or purple tinge along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often used as a decorative plant in both residential and commercial settings."
