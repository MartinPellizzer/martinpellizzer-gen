It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in acidic peatlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems with a single, showy spike of pale pink to white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This subspecies is known for its adaptability to moist environments and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
