    "intro": "Dorstenia cuspidata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf dwarf daisy, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences, which bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is closely related to other Dorstenia species, sharing similar morphological traits but distinguished by its elongated leaf shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
