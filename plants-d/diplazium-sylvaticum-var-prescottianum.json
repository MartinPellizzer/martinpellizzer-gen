    "intro": "Diplazium sylvaticum var. prescottianum, commonly known as the Prescott's shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of fiddlehead fronds. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland understories. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
