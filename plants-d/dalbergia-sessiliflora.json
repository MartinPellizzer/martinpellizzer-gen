    "intro": "Dalbergia sessiliflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its high demand in musical instrument making, it is also a species of conservation concern."
