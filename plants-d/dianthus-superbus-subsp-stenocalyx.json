    "intro": "Dianthus superbus subsp. stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-calyx carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of flowers on tall, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and drought tolerance."
