It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a subtle fragrance. The varietal form, latifolia, is distinguished by its broader leaf morphology compared to the typical species."
