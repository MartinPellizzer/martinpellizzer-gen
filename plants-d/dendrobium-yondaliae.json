    "intro": "Dendrobium yondaliae, commonly known as the Yondalia orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with yellow and pink markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium yondaliae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
