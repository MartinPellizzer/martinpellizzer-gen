    "intro": "Draba arida, commonly known as the desert mouse ear, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Draba arida is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
