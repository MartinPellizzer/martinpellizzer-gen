    "intro": "Dendrobium fulgidum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium fulgidum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in horticulture."
