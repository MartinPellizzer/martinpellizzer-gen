    "intro": "Dendrophthora apiculata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Dendrophthora apiculata plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various organisms."
