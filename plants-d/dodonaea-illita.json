    "intro": "Dodonaea illita, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, round, silver-gray leaves that resemble silver coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Dodonaea illita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
