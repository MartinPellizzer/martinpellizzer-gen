    "intro": "Dendrobium sulphuratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. The plant's unique coloration and growth pattern make it a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts."
