    "intro": "Dalea pseudocorymbosa, commonly known as the bluebonnet, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets, and it produces pods that split open to release its seeds. Dalea pseudocorymbosa plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
