    "intro": "Ditassa myrtilloides, commonly known as the purple-flowered dwarf heather, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
