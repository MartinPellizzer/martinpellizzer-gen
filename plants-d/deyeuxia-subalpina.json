    "intro": "Deyeuxia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments. Deyeuxia subalpina is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh weather conditions typical of its habitat."
