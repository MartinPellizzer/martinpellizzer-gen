    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. carota, commonly known as the common carrot, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and a taproot that is typically orange in color due to its high beta-carotene content. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences called umbels. The root is the primary edible part, widely cultivated for its nutritional value and culinary uses."
