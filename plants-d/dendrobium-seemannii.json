    "intro": "Dendrobium seemannii, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its often-dry environment. Dendrobium seemannii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
