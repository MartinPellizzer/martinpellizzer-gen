    "intro": "Diplolabellum confluens, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, thallus-like structure that forms compact, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a flattened, ribbon-like body covered in small, scale-like structures. Diplolabellum confluens typically thrives in humid environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and play a crucial role in its sexual reproduction."
