    "intro": "Delphinium attenuatum, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with spikes of blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Delphinium attenuatum is valued in gardens for its striking appearance but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
