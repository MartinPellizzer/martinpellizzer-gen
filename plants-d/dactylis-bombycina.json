    "intro": "Dactylis bombycina, commonly known as the woolly grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale green spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Dactylis bombycina is also valued as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional content."
