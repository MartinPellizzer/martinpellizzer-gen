    "intro": "Dalbergia emarginata, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
