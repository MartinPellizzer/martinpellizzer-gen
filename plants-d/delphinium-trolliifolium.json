    "intro": "Delphinium trolliifolium, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive silvery underside that helps reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. Delphinium trolliifolium is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
