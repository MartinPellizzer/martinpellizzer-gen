    "intro": "Drosera huegelii var. huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing on a single stem above the rosette. It is a perennial species that thrives in moist conditions and requires careful watering to maintain its health."
