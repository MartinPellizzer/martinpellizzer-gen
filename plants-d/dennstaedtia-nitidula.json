    "intro": "Dennstaedtia nitidula, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often glossy and have a distinct, upright growth habit. The plant typically has a rhizomatous structure, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are typically clustered in a row along the veins. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
