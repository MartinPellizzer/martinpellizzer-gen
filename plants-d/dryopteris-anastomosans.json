It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a creeping habit that allows it to spread across the ground. The rhizomes are thick and fleshy, contributing to its ability to survive in challenging conditions."
