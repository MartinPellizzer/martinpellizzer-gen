    "intro": "Drymoanthus flavus, commonly known as the yellow drymoanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette shape to retain moisture. Drymoanthus flavus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
