    "intro": "Dryopteris cesatiana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length, often with a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats."
