    "intro": "Desmanthus punctatus, commonly known as the prickly desmanthus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Desmanthus punctatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
