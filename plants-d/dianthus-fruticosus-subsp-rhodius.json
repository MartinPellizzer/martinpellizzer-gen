    "intro": "Dianthus fruticosus subsp. rhodius, commonly known as the creeping pinks, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
