    "intro": "Daucus carota, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and has been naturalized in many other regions. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are white with a single red or purple central petal, forming an umbrella-like inflorescence. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two halves when mature, each containing a single seed."
