    "intro": "Dierama formosum, commonly known as the fountain grass, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves, creating a fountain-like appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flower spikes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Dierama formosum is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping, making it a popular choice in water-efficient landscapes."
