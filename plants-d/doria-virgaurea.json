    "intro": "Doria virgaurea, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pendulous fruits known as pods. These pods turn from green to reddish-brown as they mature and split open to release seeds. Doria virgaurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
