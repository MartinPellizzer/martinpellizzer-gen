    "intro": "Diplacus glutinosus var. stellatus, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which can trap insects and deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and woodland edges. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
