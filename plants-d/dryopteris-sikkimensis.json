    "intro": "Dryopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
