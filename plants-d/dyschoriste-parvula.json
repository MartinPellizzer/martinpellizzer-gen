It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Dyschoriste parvula is often found in rocky or clay soils and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
