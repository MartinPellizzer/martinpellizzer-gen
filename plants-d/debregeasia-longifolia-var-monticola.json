    "intro": "Debregeasia longifolia var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain debregeasia, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
