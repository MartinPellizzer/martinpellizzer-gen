    "intro": "Dryopteris paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other waterlogged environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris paludicola plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystems."
