    "intro": "Diplazium dietrichianum, commonly known as the mountain staghorn fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss, giving it a unique, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular epiphytic species in horticulture. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. Diplazium dietrichianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscape design in tropical and subtropical regions."
