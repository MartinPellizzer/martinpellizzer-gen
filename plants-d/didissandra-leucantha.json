    "intro": "Didissandra leucantha, commonly known as the white sandstone plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, white to pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental appeal and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
