    "intro": "Dactylorhiza koutsourana, commonly known as the Greek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Balkans, particularly Greece and Albania. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and is often found in calcareous soils, thriving in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
