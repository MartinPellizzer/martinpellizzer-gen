    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Dicranopteris. It is a perennial aquatic fern characterized by its long, narrow, and often broad leaves that float on the water surface. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, delicate texture. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
