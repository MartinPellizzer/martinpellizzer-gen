It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale blue petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
