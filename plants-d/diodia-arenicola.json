    "intro": "Diodia arenicola, commonly known as beach dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Diodia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
