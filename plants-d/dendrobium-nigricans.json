    "intro": "Dendrobium nigricans, commonly known as the black orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis that helps store water. Dendrobium nigricans is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique and dramatic floral display."
