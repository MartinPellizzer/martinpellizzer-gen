    "intro": "Dactylorhiza merovensis, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems bearing numerous showy flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple and are arranged in a loose spike, with three sepals and three petals. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
