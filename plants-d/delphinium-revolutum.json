    "intro": "Delphinium revolutum, commonly known as the revolute larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Delphinium revolutum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its presence of alkaloids."
