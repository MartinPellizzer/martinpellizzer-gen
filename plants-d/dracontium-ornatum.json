    "intro": "Dracontium ornatum, commonly known as the showy arrowleaf, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracontium ornatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage and unique appearance."
