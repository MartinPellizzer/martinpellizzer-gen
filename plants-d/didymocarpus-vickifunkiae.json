    "intro": "Didymocarpus vickifunkiae, commonly known as the Vickifunk's flamefruit, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a unique, tangy flavor. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
