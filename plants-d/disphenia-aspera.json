It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willowherbs and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its rough texture. Disphenia aspera is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
