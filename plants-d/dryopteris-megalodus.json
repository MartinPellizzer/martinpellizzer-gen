    "intro": "Dryopteris megalodus, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's robust rhizome system allows it to spread and establish dense colonies in suitable habitats."
