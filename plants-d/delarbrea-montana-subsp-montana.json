    "intro": "Delarbrea montana subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain delarbrea, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
