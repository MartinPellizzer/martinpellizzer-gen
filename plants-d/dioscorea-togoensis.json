    "intro": "Dioscorea togoensis, commonly known as Togo yam, is a climbing vine native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. However, like many yam species, it contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation before consumption."
