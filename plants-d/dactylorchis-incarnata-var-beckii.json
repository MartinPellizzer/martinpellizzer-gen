It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and has a unique relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
