    "intro": "Dendrobium peripetasma, commonly known as the variable dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis. Dendrobium peripetasma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
