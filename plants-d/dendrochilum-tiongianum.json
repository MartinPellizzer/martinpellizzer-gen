    "intro": "Dendrochilum tiongianum, commonly known as the Tiongian Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrochilum tiongianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
