    "intro": "Diospyros oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and sometimes alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. Its wood is hard and dense, making it valuable for traditional crafts and furniture. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
