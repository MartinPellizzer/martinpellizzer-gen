    "intro": "Drosera atrostyla, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, sticky glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden mucilage. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with the glands primarily concentrated at the tips. Drosera atrostyla is a hardy species that can survive in a variety of moist environments, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
