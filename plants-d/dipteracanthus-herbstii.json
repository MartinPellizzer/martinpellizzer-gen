    "intro": "Dipteracanthus herbstii, commonly known as the Herbst's dipteracanthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often attracting specific pollinators like hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
