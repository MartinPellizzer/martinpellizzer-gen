    "intro": "Drymaria carinata var. perennis, commonly known as the perennial sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soils and drought conditions. Its leaves are succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas."
