    "intro": "Dracaena marmorata, commonly known as the marble queen dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with white and green streaks that create a marble-like appearance. The plant has long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often edged with yellow or white, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena marmorata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
