    "intro": "Didymocarpus schefferi, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are edible, though the seeds are often toxic, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments."
