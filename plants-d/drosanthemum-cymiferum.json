    "intro": "Drosanthemum cymiferum, commonly known as the woolly daisies, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Drosanthemum cymiferum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
