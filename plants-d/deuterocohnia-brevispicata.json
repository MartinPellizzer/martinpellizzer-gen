It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, lanceolate leaves. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. It is often found in alpine and paramo ecosystems, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
