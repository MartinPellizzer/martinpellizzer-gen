    "intro": "Delosperma inaequale, commonly known as the unequal ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for arid climates."
