It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems with small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or bogs. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
