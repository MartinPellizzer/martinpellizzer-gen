    "intro": "Draba borealis var. maxima, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has basal rosettes of narrow, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long periods of snow cover. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh environment."
