    "intro": "Digitaria marginata, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
