    "intro": "Desmodium retusum, commonly known as hairy senna, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage."
