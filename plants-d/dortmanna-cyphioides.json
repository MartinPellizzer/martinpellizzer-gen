    "intro": "Dortmanna cyphioides, commonly known as the common marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Dortmanna cyphioides plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
