    "intro": "Dorstenia tentaculata, commonly known as the \"tentacle plant,\" is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, spirally arranged leaves that resemble tendrils, which help it climb and anchor to supports. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dorstenia tentaculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage."
