It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically leathery and have a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its thick, fleshy stems and adaptive leaves help it survive in its natural habitat."
