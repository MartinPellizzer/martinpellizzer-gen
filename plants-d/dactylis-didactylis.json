    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dactylis didactylus, commonly known as two-leaf grass or sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in grasslands and pastures. Dactylis didactylis is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
