    "intro": "Dryas crenata, commonly known as the Alpine avens, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Dryas crenata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
