    "intro": "Dolichos kilimandscharicus subsp. kilimandscharicus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dolichos, is a climbing legume native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves with oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
