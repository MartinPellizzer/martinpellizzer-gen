    "intro": "Dubautia laxa, commonly known as the slender Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. Dubautia laxa thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
