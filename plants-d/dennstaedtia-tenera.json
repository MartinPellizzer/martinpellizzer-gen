    "intro": "Dennstaedtia tenera, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds."
