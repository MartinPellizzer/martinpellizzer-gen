    "intro": "Diplazium tabalosense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Diplazium tabalosense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
