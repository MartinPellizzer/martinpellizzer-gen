    "intro": "Dendrophthoe heynei, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, primarily in the family Rubiaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Thailand, and Indonesia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in forest ecosystems."
