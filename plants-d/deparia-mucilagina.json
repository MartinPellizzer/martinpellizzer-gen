    "intro": "Deparia mucilagina, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, often bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's rhizomes are covered in a mucilaginous substance, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its leaves are typically pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often clustered closely together. This fern thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found in rainforests and swampy habitats."
