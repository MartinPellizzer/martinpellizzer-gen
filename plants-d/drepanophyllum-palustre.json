    "intro": "Drepanophyllum palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in damp, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of marshes. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Drepanophyllum palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
