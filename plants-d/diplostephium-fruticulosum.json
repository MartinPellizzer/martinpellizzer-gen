    "intro": "Diplostephium fruticulosum, commonly known as the bristly burrgrass, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and the presence of hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, fruiting structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert vegetation."
