    "intro": "Drymaria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear or mouse-ear speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, grayish-green leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
