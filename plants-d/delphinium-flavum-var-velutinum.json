    "intro": "Delphinium flavum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. Delphinium flavum var. velutinum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
