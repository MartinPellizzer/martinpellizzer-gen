    "intro": "Dryopteris raddii var. itatiayensis, commonly known as the Itatiay\u00e9 fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Dryopteris genus. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
