    "intro": "Danthonia luzoniensis, commonly known as Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and forest margins. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
