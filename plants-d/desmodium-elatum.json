It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and it often grows in disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that help in reducing water loss. Desmodium elatum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
