    "intro": "Dendrobium georgei, commonly known as the George's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a greenish throat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients. Dendrobium georgei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
