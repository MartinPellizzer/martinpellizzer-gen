    "intro": "Diplazium stenochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-chalmer fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium stenochlamys thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
