    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscoatra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris fuscoatra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
