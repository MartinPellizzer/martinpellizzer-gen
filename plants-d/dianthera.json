    "intro": "Dianthera, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that resemble butterflies, with five petals arranged in a distinctive pattern. Dianthera species are typically found in temperate regions, particularly in the western United States, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to the plant's overall appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Dianthera grandiflora, which is notable for its striking blue or purple blooms."
