    "intro": "Damasonium alisma subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. It plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
