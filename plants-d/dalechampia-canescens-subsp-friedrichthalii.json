    "intro": "Dalechampia canescens subsp. friedrichthalii, commonly known as the woolly dalechampia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. This subspecies is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often striking floral structures."
