    "intro": "Dryopteris conformis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative growth. Dryopteris conformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and garden settings."
