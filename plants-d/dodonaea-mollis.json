    "intro": "Dodonaea mollis, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Dodonaea mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian communities."
