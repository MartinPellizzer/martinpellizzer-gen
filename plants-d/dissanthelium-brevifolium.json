    "intro": "Dissanthelium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaf tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are short and compact. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
