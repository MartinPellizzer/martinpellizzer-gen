    "intro": "Dalea ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of oval-shaped leaflets, which give it its common name. Dalea ovalifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
