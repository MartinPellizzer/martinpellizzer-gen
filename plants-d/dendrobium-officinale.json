It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its medicinal properties, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
