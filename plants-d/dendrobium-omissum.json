    "intro": "Dendrobium omissum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Dendrobium omissum is also noted for its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, aiding its survival in its natural habitat."
