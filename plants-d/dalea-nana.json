    "intro": "Dalea nana, commonly known as dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea nana is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems."
