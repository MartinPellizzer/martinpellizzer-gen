It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Diasperus kanalophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
