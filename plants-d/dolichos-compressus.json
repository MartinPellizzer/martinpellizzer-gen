    "intro": "Dolichos compressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hyacinth bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root nodules."
