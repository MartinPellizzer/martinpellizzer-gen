    "intro": "Dendrobium wichersii, commonly known as the Wicher's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, fragrant aroma. Dendrobium wichersii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
