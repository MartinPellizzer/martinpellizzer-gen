    "intro": "Daemonorops microthamnus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its unique, palm-like appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk and produces feathery, compound leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
