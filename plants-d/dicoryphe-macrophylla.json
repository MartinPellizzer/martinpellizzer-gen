    "intro": "Dicoryphe macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its showy white flowers bloom in the early morning and emit a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. The leaves are supported by long, flexible petioles that help them float on the water's surface."
