    "intro": "Dalbergia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purpleheart tree, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking purple stems and leaves, which turn red or purple as they mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
