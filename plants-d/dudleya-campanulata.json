    "intro": "Dudleya campanulata, commonly known as the bell Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
