    "intro": "Draba maxima, commonly known as the giant whitlow grass, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early summer. Draba maxima is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering period is short, and it plays a role in stabilizing rocky and barren landscapes."
