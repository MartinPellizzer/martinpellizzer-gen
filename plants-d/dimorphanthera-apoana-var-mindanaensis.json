    "intro": "Dimorphanthera apoana var. mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao dimorphanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal panicles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
