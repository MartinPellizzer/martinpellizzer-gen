It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood with a high oil content. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable species for ecological studies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
