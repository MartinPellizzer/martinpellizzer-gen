    "intro": "Digitaria pusilla, commonly known as little fingergrass, is a small annual grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, pale green to brown flowers. Due to its low height and compact growth, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
