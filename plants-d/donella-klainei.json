    "intro": "Donella klainei, commonly known as the Klaine's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Donella klainei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of small aquatic invertebrates."
