    "intro": "Dorstenia ruahensis, commonly known as the Ruaheni mountain fig, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted leaves that resemble the shape of a spiral staircase. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
