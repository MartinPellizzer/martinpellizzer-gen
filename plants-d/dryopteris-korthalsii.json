    "intro": "Dryopteris korthalsii, commonly known as Korthals' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
