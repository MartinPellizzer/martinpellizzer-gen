    "intro": "Dolichos decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, slender pods. Its seeds are encased in a thin, fibrous membrane, which aids in their dispersal. Dolichos decipiens is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
