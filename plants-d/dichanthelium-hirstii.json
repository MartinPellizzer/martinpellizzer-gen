    "intro": "Dichanthelium hirstii, commonly known as the Hirst's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it is often found in wetland ecosystems. Dichanthelium hirstii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
