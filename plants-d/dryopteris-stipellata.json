    "intro": "Dryopteris stipellata, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
