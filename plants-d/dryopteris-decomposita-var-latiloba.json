    "intro": "Dryopteris decomposita var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with broad, often slightly curved pinnae that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the pinnae. This variety is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various woodland habitats."
