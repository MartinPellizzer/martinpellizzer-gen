It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and striking coloration, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
