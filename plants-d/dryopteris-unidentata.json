    "intro": "Dryopteris unidentata, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shady garden settings."
