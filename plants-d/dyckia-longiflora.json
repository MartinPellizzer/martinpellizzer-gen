    "intro": "Dyckia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Dyckia longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
