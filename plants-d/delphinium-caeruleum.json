    "intro": "Delphinium caeruleum, commonly known as blue larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
