    "intro": "Diplazium moultonii, commonly known as Moulton's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique botanical feature."
