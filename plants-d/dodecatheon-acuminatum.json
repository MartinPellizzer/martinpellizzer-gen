    "intro": "Dodecatheon acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and ovate, pointed leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding a striking visual element to early-season gardens."
