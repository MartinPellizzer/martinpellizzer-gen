    "intro": "Dendrochilum mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and linear, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a lip that is often brightly colored and intricately patterned. Its growth habit is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks. Dendrochilum mearnsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
