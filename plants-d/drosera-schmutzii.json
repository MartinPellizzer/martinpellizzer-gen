    "intro": "Drosera schmutzii, commonly known as the Schmutzii Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet, adhesive substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and moist conditions to thrive. Its small, clustered leaves form a rosette shape, and it produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months. Drosera schmutzii is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in carnivorous plants."
