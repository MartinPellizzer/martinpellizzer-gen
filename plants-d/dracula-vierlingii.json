    "intro": "Dracula vierlingii, commonly known as the four-flowered dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, intricate draculas. The plant produces four showy, red and violet-colored flowers on a single stem, each with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
