    "intro": "Daucus littoralis var. negevensis, commonly known as the Negev coastal carrot, is a rare variant of the coastal carrot native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in Israel and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its root system is relatively short and fibrous, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
