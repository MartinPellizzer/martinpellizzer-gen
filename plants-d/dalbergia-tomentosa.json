    "intro": "Dalbergia tomentosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legumes containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
