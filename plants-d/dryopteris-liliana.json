    "intro": "Dryopteris liliana, commonly known as the Lilian's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in spherical, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
