    "intro": "Dryopteris boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
