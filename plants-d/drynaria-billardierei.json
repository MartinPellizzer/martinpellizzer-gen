    "intro": "Drynaria billardierei, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in challenging substrates. Drynaria billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
