    "intro": "Delopyrum filiforme, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Delopyrum filiforme plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
