    "intro": "Diplazium melanocaulon var. melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy stems and fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new fronds. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
