    "intro": "Derouetia bourgaei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Derouetia bourgaei is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution."
