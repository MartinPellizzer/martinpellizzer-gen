    "intro": "Delphinium wuqiaense, commonly known as the Wuqia larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers have five showy petals that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
