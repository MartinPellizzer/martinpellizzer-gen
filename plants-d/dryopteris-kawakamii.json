    "intro": "Dryopteris kawakamii, commonly known as Kawakami's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
