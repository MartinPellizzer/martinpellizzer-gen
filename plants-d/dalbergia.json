    "intro": "Dalbergia, commonly known as rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and Asia, and are valued for their dense, dark-colored wood. Many species of Dalbergia are used in the production of high-quality furniture, musical instruments, and decorative items due to their strength and aesthetic appeal. The genus includes over 200 species, some of which are critically endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss. Botanically, Dalbergia species are characterized by their compound leaves, pod-like fruits, and often fragrant flowers."
