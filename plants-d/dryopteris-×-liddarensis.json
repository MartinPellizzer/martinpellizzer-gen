    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 liddarensis, commonly known as the Liddar Valley fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing fronds in the summer, which are usually darker in color and have a more robust structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
