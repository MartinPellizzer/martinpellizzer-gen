    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. pseudoglomerata, commonly known as false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
