    "intro": "Drynaria angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive colonies, contributing to its hardy nature. Drynaria angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
