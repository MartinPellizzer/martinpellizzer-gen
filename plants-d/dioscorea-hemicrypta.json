    "intro": "Dioscorea hemicrypta, commonly known as the creeping yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped and its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous. The tubers of Dioscorea hemicrypta are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species."
