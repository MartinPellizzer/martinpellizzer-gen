It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark red or purple color. The wood of Diospyros pseudebenum is hard and durable, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making. It is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit, which can be edible when fully ripe."
