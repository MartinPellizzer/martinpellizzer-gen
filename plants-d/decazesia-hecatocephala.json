    "intro": "Decazesia hecatocephala, commonly known as the star-shaped tamarind tree, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like inflorescences and long, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
