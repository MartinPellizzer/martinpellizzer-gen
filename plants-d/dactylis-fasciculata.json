    "intro": "Dactylis fasciculata, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Dactylis fasciculata is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it is sometimes used in forage agriculture."
