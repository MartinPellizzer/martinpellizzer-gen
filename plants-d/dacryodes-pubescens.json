It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
