It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and salt flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Donax sativus is also an important forage plant for certain wildlife species."
