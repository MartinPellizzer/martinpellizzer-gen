    "intro": "Dalea barbata, commonly known as the barbed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with small, barbed hairs that give it its common name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that are often covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer."
