    "intro": "Dryopteris rivularioides var. pseudothelypteris, commonly known as the river fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to wet substrates. The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters, making it a striking addition to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
