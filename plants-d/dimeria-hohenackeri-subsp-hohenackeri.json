It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and succulent collections."
