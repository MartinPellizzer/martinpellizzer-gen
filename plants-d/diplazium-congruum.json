    "intro": "Diplazium congruum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces shield-shaped, often hairy leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Diplazium congruum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
