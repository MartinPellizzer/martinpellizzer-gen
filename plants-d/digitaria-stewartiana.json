It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, triangular seeds. Digitaria stewartiana is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
