    "intro": "Digitaria domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to flooding. Digitaria domingensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
