    "intro": "Dryopteris powellii, commonly known as Powell's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often arched or curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
