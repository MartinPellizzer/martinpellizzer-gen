    "intro": "Danais purpurea, commonly known as the purple danais, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Danais purpurea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
