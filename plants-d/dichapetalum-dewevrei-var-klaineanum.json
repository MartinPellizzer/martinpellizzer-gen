    "intro": "Dichapetalum dewevrei var. klaineanum, commonly known as the Klaeneanum dichapetalum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically orange or red in color. The plant is known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
