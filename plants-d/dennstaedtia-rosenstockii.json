It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, shield-shaped spore cases. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
