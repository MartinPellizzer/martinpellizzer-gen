    "intro": "Dendrobium goodallianum, commonly known as the Goodall's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium goodallianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
