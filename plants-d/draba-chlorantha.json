    "intro": "Draba chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Draba chlorantha produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, contributing to the early bloom of alpine flora."
