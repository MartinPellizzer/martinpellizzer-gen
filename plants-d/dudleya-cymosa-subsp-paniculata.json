    "intro": "Dudleya cymosa subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
