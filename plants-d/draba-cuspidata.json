    "intro": "Draba cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a sharp, pointed tip, which gives it its common name. Draba cuspidata thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
