    "intro": "Dryopteris habbemensis, commonly known as the Habbemense Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests where it grows on rocky substrates or in leaf litter. Its spores are released from fertile fronds, which develop on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
