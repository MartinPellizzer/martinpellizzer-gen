    "intro": "Diplazium japonicum var. conilii, commonly known as the Japanese brake fern, is a variant of the common brake fern native to Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its upright, sparsely branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
