    "intro": "Dendrobium acutifolium, commonly known as the acute-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and bear numerous leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and pointed, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium acutifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
