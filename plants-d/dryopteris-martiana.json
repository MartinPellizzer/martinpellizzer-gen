    "intro": "Dryopteris martiana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, compact fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters tall. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
