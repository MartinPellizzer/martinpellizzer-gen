    "intro": "Dactylis \u00d7 intercedens f. orlicensis, commonly known as the Orlic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
