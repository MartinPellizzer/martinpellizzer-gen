    "intro": "Dendrophylax fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
