The plant is aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in slow-moving freshwater environments. Its fronds are usually divided into three parts, giving it the common name \"triphylla,\" which means \"three-leaved.\" This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
