    "intro": "Dichapetalum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved dichapetalum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
