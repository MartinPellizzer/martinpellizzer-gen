    "intro": "Dryopteris yaeyamensis, commonly known as the Yaeyama wood fern, is a rare fern species native to the Yaeyama Islands of Okinawa, Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
