    "intro": "Deyeuxia hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and tundra ecosystems. Deyeuxia hyperborea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its harsh environment. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude flora."
