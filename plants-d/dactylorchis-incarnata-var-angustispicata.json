It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
