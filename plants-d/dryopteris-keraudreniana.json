    "intro": "Dryopteris keraudreniana, commonly known as the Keraudren's wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
