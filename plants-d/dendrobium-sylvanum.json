    "intro": "Dendrobium sylvanum, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Dendrobium sylvanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral characteristics."
