    "intro": "Dryopteris glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
