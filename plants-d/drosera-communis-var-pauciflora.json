It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and pink, usually appearing in late summer. It is a low-growing species with a rosette structure, and it relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
