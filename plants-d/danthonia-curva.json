    "intro": "Danthonia curva, commonly known as the curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and distinctive curling leaves that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. It has a clump-forming habit and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring. Danthonia curva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
