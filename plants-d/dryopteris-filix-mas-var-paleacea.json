    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically lighter green in color compared to the standard variety. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddleheads emerging in early spring and unfurling into compound leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typically in two rows along the veins. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to moist, shaded environments."
