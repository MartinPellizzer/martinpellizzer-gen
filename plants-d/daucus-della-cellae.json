    "intro": "Daucus della-cellae, commonly known as the Italian cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces oval, ridged fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Its foliage has a mild, aromatic scent reminiscent of parsley, making it a distinctive member of its family."
