It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Deyeuxia nyingchiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
