    "intro": "Dendrobium nobile f. cooksonianum, commonly known as the Cookson's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically fragrant, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and are often arranged in clusters. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
