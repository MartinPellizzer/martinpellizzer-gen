    "intro": "Dioscorea mosqueirensis, commonly known as the Mosqueirensis yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source in various African communities."
