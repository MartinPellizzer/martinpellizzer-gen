    "intro": "Dipteracanthus humilis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf dipteracanthus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
