    "intro": "Delphinium andersonii var. cognatum, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often avoided in gardens."
