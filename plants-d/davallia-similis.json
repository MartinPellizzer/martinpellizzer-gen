    "intro": "Davallia similis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense, cushion-like clusters. Davallia similis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of care in indoor settings."
