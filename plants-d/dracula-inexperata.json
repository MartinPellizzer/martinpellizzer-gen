    "intro": "Dracula inexperata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its pale, translucent petals and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on trees without soil. The plant's flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Dracula inexperata is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of pristine, undisturbed ecosystems."
