    "intro": "Dryopteris merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan wood fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically biennial. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris merrillii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
