The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
