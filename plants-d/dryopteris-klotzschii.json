    "intro": "Dryopteris klotzschii, commonly known as the Klotzsch's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
