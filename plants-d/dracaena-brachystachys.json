It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically dark green with a slight blue or silver hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers, though it is rarely cultivated for its blooms. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Dracaena brachystachys is popular as a houseplant due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
