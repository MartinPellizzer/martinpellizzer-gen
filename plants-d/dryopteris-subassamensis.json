    "intro": "Dryopteris subassamensis, commonly known as the Assam shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northeastern regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
