    "intro": "Dryopteris mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Mauritius. It is a small, delicate plant with feathery, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The Mauritius water fern is also notable for its role in the unique biodiversity of the island's ecosystems."
