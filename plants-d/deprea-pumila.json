    "intro": "Deprea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
