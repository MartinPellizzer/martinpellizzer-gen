    "intro": "Dypsis ceracea, commonly known as the plectranthus or velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, tree-like structure with a smooth, pale trunk. The plant produces striking, clustered inflorescences of small, white to yellowish flowers, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dypsis ceracea is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens due to its aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
