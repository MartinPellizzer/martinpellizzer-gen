    "intro": "Dryopteris scalpturoides var. subbipinnata, commonly known as the variegated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that often display a striking variegation of green and gold. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
