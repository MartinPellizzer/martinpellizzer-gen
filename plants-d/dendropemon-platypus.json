    "intro": "Dendropemon platypus, commonly known as the flat-tongued orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flattened tongue-shaped petals and a compact, clustered growth habit. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale green or white with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dendropemon platypus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
