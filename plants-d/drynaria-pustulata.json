    "intro": "Drynaria pustulata, commonly known as the bumpy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Drynaria pustulata is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
