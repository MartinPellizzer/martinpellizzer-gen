    "intro": "Dendromecon rigida, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies, and is characterized by its erect, candle-like stems and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its striking appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
