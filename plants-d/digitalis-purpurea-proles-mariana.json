    "intro": "Digitalis purpurea proles mariana, commonly known as the Marian purple foxglove, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, requiring caution when handling."
