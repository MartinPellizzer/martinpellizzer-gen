    "intro": "Dendrobium scirpoides, commonly known as the grass-like orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are long and narrow, resembling grass, which is why it is given its common name. Dendrobium scirpoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
