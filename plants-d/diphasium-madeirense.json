    "intro": "Diphasium madeirense, commonly known as the Madeira orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Madeira. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
