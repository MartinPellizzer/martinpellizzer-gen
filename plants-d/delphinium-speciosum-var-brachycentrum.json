    "intro": "Delphinium speciosum var. brachycentrum, commonly known as the short-stalked larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, arranged in a spire-like formation at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, bitter scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
