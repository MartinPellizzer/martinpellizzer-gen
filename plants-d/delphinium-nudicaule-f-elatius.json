    "intro": "Delphinium nudicaule f. elatius, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The foliage consists of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. This variety is characterized by its elongated flower stems, which give it a more refined appearance compared to other delphinium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
