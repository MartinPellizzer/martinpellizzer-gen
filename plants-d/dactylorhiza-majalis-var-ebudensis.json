    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. ebudensis, commonly known as the Burren orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the limestone grasslands of the Burren in Ireland. It is a rhizomatous herb with erect, leafless stems that bear a single spike of white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a distinctive pseudobulb-like structure and produces small, showy flowers that are typically 1\u20132 cm in diameter. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its native habitat. The species is rare and protected, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
