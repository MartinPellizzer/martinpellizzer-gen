    "intro": "Dracontia montis-mortensis, commonly known as the death mountain dragon fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Mont Mort region in France. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that resemble the scales of a dragon, giving it its evocative common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist microclimates, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded crevices. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with spores produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecological requirements, Dracontia montis-mortensis is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
