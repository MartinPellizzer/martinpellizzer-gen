    "intro": "Dissotis senegambiensis var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dissotis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of West Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively rare and of interest to botanists and conservationists."
