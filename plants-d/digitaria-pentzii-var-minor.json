    "intro": "Digitaria pentzii var. minor, commonly known as dwarf fingergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Digitaria genus. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. This species is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
