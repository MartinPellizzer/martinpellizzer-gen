    "intro": "Deparia shennongensis, commonly known as Shennong's shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and serrated margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
