    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana f. atropalustris, commonly known as the black marsh fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
