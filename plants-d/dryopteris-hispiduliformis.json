    "intro": "Dryopteris hispiduliformis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its stout, upright fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The hairy shield fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
