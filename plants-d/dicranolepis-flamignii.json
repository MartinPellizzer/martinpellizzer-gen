It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical features of Dicranolepis flamignii make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
