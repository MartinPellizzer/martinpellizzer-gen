    "intro": "Danaea muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's torchwood, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers, which are borne on long, drooping inflorescences, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has waxy, dark green leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Danaea muelleriana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
