    "intro": "Dryopteris rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, elegant fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive red or rust-colored midrib that contrasts with the lighter green pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
