    "intro": "Disa erubescens subsp. erubescens, commonly known as the red disa, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, with a white or pale pink labellum that contrasts beautifully with the rest of the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing clusters of showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
