    "intro": "Dicranolepis disticha f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous dichotomy fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The fronds are typically slender and exhibit a glabrous, or hairless, surface, which is a key feature of this particular form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
