It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellow to brown florets, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid environments. Dichrotrichum lobatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
