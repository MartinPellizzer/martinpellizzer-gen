    "intro": "Duretia spicata, commonly known as the spiky duretia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its most distinctive feature is its spiky, bract-like structures that surround the flowers, giving it its common name. Duretia spicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
