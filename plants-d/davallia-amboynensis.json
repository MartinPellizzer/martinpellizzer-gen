    "intro": "Davallia amboynensis, commonly known as the \"skeleton fern,\" is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green with a whitish or silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, helping it spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
