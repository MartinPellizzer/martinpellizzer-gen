    "intro": "Dichapetalum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, aromatic bark that has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
