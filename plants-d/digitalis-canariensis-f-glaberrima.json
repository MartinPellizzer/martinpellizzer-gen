    "intro": "Digitalis canariensis f. glaberrima, commonly known as the Canary Islands foxglove, is a rare and striking variant of the foxglove genus. It is characterized by its large, spurred flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in its native habitat of the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
