    "intro": "Diplazium nitens, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, and is often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shaded gardens."
