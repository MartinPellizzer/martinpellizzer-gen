    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina subsp. siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. This orchid typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a unique inflorescence structure typical of the Dactylorhiza genus. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
