It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a dense covering of brown, fibrous roots.

This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
