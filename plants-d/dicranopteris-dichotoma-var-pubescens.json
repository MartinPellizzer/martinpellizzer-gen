    "intro": "Dicranopteris dichotoma var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnate and often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are capable of floating on water surfaces. The plant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
