It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils.
