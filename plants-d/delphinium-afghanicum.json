    "intro": "Delphinium afghanicum, commonly known as the Afghan larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the delphinium genus. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value. Delphinium afghanicum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for alpine gardens and rockeries."
