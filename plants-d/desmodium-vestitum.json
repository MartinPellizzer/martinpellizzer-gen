    "intro": "Desmodium vestitum, commonly known as hairy burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium vestitum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
