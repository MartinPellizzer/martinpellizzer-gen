    "intro": "Dontostemon tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The Tibetan bellflower is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
