    "intro": "Danthonia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
