    "intro": "Dryopteris obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often curled appearance that becomes more elaborate as the plant matures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically clustered in a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
