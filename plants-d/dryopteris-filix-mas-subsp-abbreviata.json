    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. abbreviata, commonly known as the compact male fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. It features fronds that are typically shorter and more robust compared to the typical male fern, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The fronds are divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a dense, bushy look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
