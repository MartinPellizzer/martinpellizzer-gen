    "intro": "Delphinium leptocarpum, commonly known as the slender-rooted larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy layer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Delphinium leptocarpum is valued in gardens for its striking appearance but is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids."
