    "intro": "Drosera caduca, commonly known as the summer beauty or the temporary sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant is notable for its ability to shed its leaves during dry periods, a trait that allows it to survive in arid environments. It blooms with small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. Drosera caduca thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires specific conditions to maintain its unique carnivorous adaptations."
