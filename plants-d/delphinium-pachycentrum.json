    "intro": "Delphinium pachycentrum, commonly known as the thick-centred larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a coarse texture, and the plant prefers well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium pachycentrum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, requiring careful handling."
