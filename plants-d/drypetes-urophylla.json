    "intro": "Drypetes urophylla, commonly known as the yellow ghost tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
