It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often used in traditional medicine.
