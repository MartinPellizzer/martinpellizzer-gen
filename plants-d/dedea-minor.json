    "intro": "Dedea minor, commonly known as the lesser dead-nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and sage. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pale purple or white, arranged in whorls along the stems. Dedea minor is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
