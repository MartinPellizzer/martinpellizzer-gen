    "intro": "Dipogon lignosus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has a dense, evergreen canopy with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, white flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
