    "intro": "Dendrophorbium usgorense, commonly known as the Uskorensky tree parasite, is a rare and specialized parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It relies entirely on its host tree for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host over time. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with a slender, vine-like structure and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for efficient nutrient absorption. It produces inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecological niche, Dendrophorbium usgorense is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
