    "intro": "Drypetes fernandopoana, commonly known as the Malay balsa or white balsa, is a tropical tree belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, simple leaves that are usually alternate and elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its lightweight wood, which has historical uses in boatbuilding and as a substitute for balsa wood."
