    "intro": "Dennstaedtia villosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in spore dispersal. The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
