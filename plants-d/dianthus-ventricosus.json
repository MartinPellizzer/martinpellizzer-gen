    "intro": "Dianthus ventricosus, commonly known as the cushion campion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit, often forming dense mats or cushions of foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Dianthus ventricosus is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
