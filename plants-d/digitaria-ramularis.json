    "intro": "Digitaria ramularis, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Digitaria ramularis is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
