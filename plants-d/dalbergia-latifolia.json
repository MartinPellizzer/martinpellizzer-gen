    "intro": "Dalbergia latifolia, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically 7 to 11, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. The tree is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules."
