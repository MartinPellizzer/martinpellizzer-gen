It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Desmopsis dubia is considered a rare and endangered species."
