    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata subsp. remotiloba, commonly known as the remote fern, is a deciduous fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its sori are arranged in two rows along the margins of the pinnae, and the spores are released during the late summer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
