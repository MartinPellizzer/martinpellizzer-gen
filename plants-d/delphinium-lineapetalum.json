    "intro": "Delphinium lineapetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of spurred, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a coarse texture and a distinctive blue-green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to livestock and humans."
