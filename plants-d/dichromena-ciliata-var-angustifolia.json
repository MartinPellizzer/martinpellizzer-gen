It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its foliage and floral structure make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
