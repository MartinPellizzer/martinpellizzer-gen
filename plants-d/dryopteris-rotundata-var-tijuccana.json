    "intro": "Dryopteris rotundata var. tijuccana, commonly known as the Tijucu fern, is a variant of the round-leaf wood fern. It is native to Central America and features fronds that are deeply divided into rounded, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
