    "intro": "Dischidia hoyoides, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a vining epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and ability to climb using aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dischidia hoyoides is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
