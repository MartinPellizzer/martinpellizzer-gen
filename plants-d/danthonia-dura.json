    "intro": "Danthonia dura, commonly known as hardy oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
