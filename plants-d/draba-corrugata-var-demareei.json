    "intro": "Draba corrugata var. demareei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Draba corrugata var. demareei is adapted to high-altitude habitats and is an important component of alpine plant communities."
