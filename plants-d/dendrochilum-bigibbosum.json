    "intro": "Dendrochilum bigibbosum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the late spring to early summer, and its roots are adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in forested areas, where it thrives in the understory with partial sunlight. The orchid's botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
