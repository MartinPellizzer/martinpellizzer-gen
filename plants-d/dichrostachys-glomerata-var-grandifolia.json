    "intro": "Dichrostachys glomerata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered burr legume, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in agroforestry and for soil stabilization."
