    "intro": "Dryopteris triangularifrons, commonly known as the triangular shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
