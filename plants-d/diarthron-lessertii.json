It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, Diarthron lessertii is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in South American ecosystems."
