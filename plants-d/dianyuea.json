    "intro": "Dianyuea, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in mountainous regions. The plants typically feature showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with white or yellow markings. Dianyuea species are perennial herbs with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic beauty."
