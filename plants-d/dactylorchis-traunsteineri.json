    "intro": "Dactylorchis traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
