    "intro": "Draba turgida subsp. turgida, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It has a compact rosette structure and produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its preference for cold climates, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
