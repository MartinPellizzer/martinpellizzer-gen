    "intro": "Diphyes dryadum, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants. Its botanical name reflects its unique growth habit, with \"diphyes\" suggesting a dual nature, possibly referring to its two distinct growth forms. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
