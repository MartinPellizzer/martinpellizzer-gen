    "intro": "Dendrocnide moroides, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leafy foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its highly toxic sap, which contains a potent mix of chemicals that cause severe skin irritation. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, despite the risks involved. The stinging tree thrives in moist, shaded environments and is a common feature of rainforests in Queensland."
