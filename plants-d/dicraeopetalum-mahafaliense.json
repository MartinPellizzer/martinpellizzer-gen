    "intro": "Dicraeopetalum mahafaliense, commonly known as the Mahafaly orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
