    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, heart-shaped leaves and tall, hollow stems that produce purple to pink flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and thrives in full sun. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
