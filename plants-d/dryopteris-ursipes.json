    "intro": "Dryopteris ursipes, commonly known as the bear's paw fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving them a finely divided, lacy appearance. The fronds are often dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, broad, and slightly curled shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
