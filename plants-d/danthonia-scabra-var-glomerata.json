    "intro": "Danthonia scabra var. glomerata, commonly known as the hairy muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
