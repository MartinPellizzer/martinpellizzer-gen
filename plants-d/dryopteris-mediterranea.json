    "intro": "Dryopteris mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean wood fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its distinctive appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
