    "intro": "Drosera macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet-smelling mucilage to trap insects. The plant's broad, waxy leaves are adapted to nutrient-poor environments, allowing it to supplement its diet with captured prey. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and wetlands. Drosera macrophylla is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique feeding mechanism."
