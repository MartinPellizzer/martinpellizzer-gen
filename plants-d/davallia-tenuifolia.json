    "intro": "Davallia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch wide. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
