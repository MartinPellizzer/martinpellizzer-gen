    "intro": "Digitaria venezuelae var. fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and South America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
