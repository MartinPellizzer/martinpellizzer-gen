    "intro": "Dracaena caboverdeana, commonly known as the Cape Verde dragon tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, arching leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena caboverdeana thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
