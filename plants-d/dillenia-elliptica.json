It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with a distinctive, cup-shaped base. Its fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds. Dillenia elliptica is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
