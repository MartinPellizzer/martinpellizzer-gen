    "intro": "Diandrostachya fulva, commonly known as the red-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its striking floral display makes it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects. Diandrostachya fulva plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
