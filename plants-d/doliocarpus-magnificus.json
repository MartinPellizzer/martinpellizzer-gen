    "intro": "Doliocarpus magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent doliocarpus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the wet forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
