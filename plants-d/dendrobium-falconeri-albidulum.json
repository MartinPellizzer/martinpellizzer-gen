    "intro": "Dendrobium falconeri albidulum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which is known for its diverse array of orchid species with varying growth habits and floral characteristics. This particular species is characterized by its slender, cane-like stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific light and temperature conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
