    "intro": "Dentaria glandulosa subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian toothbrush plant, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and parts of northern Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are glandular-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Dentaria glandulosa subsp. sibirica is notable for its frost resistance and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments."
