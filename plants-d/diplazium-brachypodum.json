    "intro": "Diplazium brachypodum, commonly known as the shortfoot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, with a dark green, leathery texture. Diplazium brachypodum thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
