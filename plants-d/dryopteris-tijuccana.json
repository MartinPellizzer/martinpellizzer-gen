    "intro": "Dryopteris tijuccana, commonly known as the Tijuana fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
