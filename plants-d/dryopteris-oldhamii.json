    "intro": "Dryopteris oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris oldhamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
