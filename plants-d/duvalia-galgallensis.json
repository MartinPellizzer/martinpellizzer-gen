    "intro": "Duvalia galgallensis, commonly known as the Galician thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
