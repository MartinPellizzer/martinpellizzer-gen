    "intro": "Diospyros cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small dates. Diospyros cordifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and musical instruments. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
