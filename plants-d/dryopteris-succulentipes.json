    "intro": "Dryopteris succulentipes, commonly known as the succulent foot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, thick fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are robust and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
