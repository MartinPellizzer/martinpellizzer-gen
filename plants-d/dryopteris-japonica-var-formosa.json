    "intro": "Dryopteris japonica var. formosa, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems."
