    "intro": "Dyckia missionum var. breviflora, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, clustered white or pink flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
