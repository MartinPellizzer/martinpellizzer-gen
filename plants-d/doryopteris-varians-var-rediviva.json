    "intro": "Doryopteris varians var. rediviva, commonly known as the rediviva fern, is a variant of the Doryopteris varians species native to certain regions of South America. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. The varietal distinction of rediviva is based on subtle morphological differences in frond shape and spore morphology compared to the typical form of Doryopteris varians."
