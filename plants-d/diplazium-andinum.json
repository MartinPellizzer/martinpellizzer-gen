    "intro": "Diplazium andinum, commonly known as Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil. Diplazium andinum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
