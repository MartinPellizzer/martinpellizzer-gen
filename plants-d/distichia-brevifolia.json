    "intro": "Distichia brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved distichia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it blooms during the warmer months. Distichia brevifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
