It is characterized by its dark, rough bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by reddish or orange fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
