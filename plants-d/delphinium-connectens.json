    "intro": "Delphinium connectens, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a hairy texture, while its flowers are showy and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Delphinium connectens is valued for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
