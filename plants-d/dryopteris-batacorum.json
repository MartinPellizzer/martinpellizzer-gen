    "intro": "Dryopteris batacorum, commonly known as the Batacorum wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
