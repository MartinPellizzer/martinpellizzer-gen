It is characterized by its large, showy yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed. Its fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, which allows for wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions."
