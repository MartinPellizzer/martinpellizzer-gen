    "intro": "Daphne oleifolia, commonly known as the olive-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a strong, often unpleasant odor when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late winter or early spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Daphne oleifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and unique fragrance."
