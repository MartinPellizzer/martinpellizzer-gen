    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. hebridensis, commonly known as the Hebridean spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as peat bogs and moorlands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a specialized root system that supports its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
