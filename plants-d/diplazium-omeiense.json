    "intro": "Diplazium omeiense, commonly known as the Omei fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. Diplazium omeiense thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
