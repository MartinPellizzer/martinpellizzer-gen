    "intro": "Draco mannii, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. One of its most notable features is the sticky, red resin it exudes, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. This plant is a rare and endangered species, adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions."
