It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky soils or in open meadows. The plant produces basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, and it bears small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with cruciform flowers. This subspecies is notable for its early blooming habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
