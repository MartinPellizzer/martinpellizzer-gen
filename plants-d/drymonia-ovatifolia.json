    "intro": "Drymonia ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are broad and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Drymonia ovatifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
