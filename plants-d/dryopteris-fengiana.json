    "intro": "Dryopteris fengiana, commonly known as the Fengshan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
