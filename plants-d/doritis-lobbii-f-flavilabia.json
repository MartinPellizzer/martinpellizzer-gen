    "intro": "Doritis lobbii f. flavilabia, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Doritis, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers that bloom in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, making it highly ornamental. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts and horticulturists. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
