    "intro": "Dryopteris sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coniferous forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris sledgei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
