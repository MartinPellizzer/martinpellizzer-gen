    "intro": "Dendrobium hasseltii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, making it relatively drought-tolerant once established."
