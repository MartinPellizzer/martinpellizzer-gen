    "intro": "Diplazium polypodioides var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
