    "intro": "Digitaria clavitricha, commonly known as the narrowleaf fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, Digitaria clavitricha is considered a common weed in many parts of the world."
