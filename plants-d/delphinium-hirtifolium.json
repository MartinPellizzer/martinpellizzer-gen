    "intro": "Delphinium hirtifolium, commonly known as the hairy-leaved larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Delphinium hirtifolium is also noted for its toxicity, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to both humans and animals."
