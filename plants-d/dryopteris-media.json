    "intro": "Dryopteris media, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris media is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
