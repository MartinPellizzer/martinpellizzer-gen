    "intro": "Dalbergia pinnata var. pinnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is valued for its hard, aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as an endangered species in some areas."
