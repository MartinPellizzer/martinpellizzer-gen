    "intro": "Deyeuxia zangxiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
