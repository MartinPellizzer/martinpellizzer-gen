    "intro": "Diospyros opaca, commonly known as the persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to reddish fruits. The fruits are fleshy, sweet, and edible when fully ripe, containing a single seed. Diospyros opaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
