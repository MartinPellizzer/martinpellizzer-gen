    "intro": "Decaschistia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, with four to six petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Decaschistia trilobata is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine vegetation."
