    "intro": "Dryopteris cutiataensis, commonly known as the Tenerife wood fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories on the island of Tenerife. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
