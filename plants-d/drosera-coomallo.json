    "intro": "Drosera coomallo, commonly known as the Coomallo Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Drosera coomallo is an important species for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils."
