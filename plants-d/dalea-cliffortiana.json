    "intro": "Dalea cliffortiana, commonly known as the cliffland milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Dalea cliffortiana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
