It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Dendrobium modestum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial shade for optimal growth."
