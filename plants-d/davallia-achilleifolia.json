    "intro": "Davallia achilleifolia, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique ability to \"walk\" by extending new growth along the ground makes it a distinctive and interesting species in the fern family."
