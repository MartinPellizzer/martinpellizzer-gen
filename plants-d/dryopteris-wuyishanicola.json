    "intro": "Dryopteris wuyishanicola, commonly known as the Wuyi mountain shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin and a deep, dark green color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
