    "intro": "Draba incana var. confusa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid or cold environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive rosette shape, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba incana var. confusa is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
