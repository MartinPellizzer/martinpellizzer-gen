    "intro": "Dryopteris lurida var. sericea, commonly known as the silvery wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white to pale green fronds, which are covered in a fine, silky coating of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
