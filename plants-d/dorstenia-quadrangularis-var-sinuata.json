    "intro": "Dorstenia quadrangularis var. sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine in some regions."
