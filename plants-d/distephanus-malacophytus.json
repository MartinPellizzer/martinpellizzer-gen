It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, branched stems and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.
