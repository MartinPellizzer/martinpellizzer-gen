    "intro": "Diporidium afzelii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy texture. Diporidium afzelii is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
