    "intro": "Dracaena ensata, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena ensata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
