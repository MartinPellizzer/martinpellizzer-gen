It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Daphne virgata is also noted for its ornamental value and is often used in horticultural displays."
