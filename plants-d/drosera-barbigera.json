It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sweet nectar to lure insects. The plant's leaves are typically prostrate or semi-upright, with a rosette-like structure. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the warmer months. Drosera barbigera thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and wetlands."
