    "intro": "Davallia scabra, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and often grow close to the soil surface. The fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
