    "intro": "Delphinium taliense var. dolichocentrum, commonly known as the long-stemmed delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with striking blue to purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, loamy soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
