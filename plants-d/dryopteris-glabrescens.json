    "intro": "Dryopteris glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The smooth wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
