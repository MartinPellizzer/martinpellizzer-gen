    "intro": "Dennstaedtia riparia, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important indicator species for aquatic environments. Its spores are released in clusters, and the fronds are usually dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The river fern plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
