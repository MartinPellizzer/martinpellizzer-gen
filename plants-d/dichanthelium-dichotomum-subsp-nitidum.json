    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in ditches. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a glossy sheen, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets arranged in pairs. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
