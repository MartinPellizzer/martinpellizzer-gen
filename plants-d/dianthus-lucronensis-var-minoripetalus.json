    "intro": "Dianthus lucronensis var. minoripetalus, commonly known as the small-petaled carnation, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, pink or white flowers with reduced petals, giving it a unique appearance compared to typical carnations. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged, wildflower-like look. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its short stature and charming blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant."
