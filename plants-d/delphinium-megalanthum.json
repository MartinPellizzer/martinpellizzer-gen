    "intro": "Delphinium megalanthum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value."
