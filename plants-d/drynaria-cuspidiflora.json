    "intro": "Drynaria cuspidiflora, commonly known as the spiky fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in small, spiny structures. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are specialized for spore production. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
