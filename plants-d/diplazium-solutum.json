    "intro": "Diplazium solutum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. Diplazium solutum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage."
