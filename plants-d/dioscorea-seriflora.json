    "intro": "Dioscorea seriflora, commonly known as the seriflorous yam, is a flowering plant belonging to the Dioscoreaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
