    "intro": "Dendrobium rarum, commonly known as the rare orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with intricate patterns. Its growth habit is characterized by a sympodial structure, with new shoots emerging from the base of the previous ones. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Dendrobium rarum is highly sought after in horticultural circles."
