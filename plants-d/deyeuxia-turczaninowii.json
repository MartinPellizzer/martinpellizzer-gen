    "intro": "Deyeuxia turczaninowii, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Deyeuxia turczaninowii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
