    "intro": "Diporidium inerme, commonly known as the nakedleaf spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellowish-green cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
