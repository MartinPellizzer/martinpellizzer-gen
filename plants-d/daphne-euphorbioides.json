    "intro": "Daphne euphorbioides, commonly known as the flame daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of bright orange-red flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
