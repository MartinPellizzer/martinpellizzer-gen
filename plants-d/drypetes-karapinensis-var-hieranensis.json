    "intro": "Drypetes karapinensis var. hieranensis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, reddish bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
