    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata var. psychrophila, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species adapted to cold, moist environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, peaty soils. It is often found in wet meadows and bogs, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
