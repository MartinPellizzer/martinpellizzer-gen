    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. perennans, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in harsh mountain climates."
