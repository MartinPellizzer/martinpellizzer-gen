It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
