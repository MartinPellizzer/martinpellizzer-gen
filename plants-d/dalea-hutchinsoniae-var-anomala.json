    "intro": "Dalea hutchinsoniae var. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous hillside milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include slender stems, small stipules, and a unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
