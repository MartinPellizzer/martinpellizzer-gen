    "intro": "Dendrochilum monodii, commonly known as the Monod's tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with white to pale yellow petals and a distinctive, often reddish lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
