    "intro": "Diplazium subserratum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly. The fronds are usually light green and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in humid conditions."
