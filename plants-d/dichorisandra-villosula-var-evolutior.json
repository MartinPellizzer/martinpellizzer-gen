    "intro": "Dichorisandra villosula var. evolutior, commonly known as the velvet leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures, with the female cones bearing a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
