    "intro": "Dichanthelium multiglandulosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of bracted flowers. The species is characterized by its numerous glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name."
