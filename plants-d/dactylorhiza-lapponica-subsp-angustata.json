    "intro": "Dactylorhiza lapponica subsp. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in wet, peaty or boggy habitats, often in shaded environments. The plant produces erect, slender stems that bear few leaves and spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
