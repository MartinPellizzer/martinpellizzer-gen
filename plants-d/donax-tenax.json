    "intro": "Donax tenax, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Donax tenax plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
