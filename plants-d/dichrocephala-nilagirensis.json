    "intro": "Dichrocephala nilagirensis, commonly known as the Nilagiri dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a dandelion. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, pappus-bearing seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
