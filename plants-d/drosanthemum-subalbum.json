    "intro": "Drosanthemum subalbum, commonly known as the white-flowered ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
