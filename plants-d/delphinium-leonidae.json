    "intro": "Delphinium leonidae, commonly known as the Leonidae larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Delphinium leonidae belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which is known for its showy flowers and often toxic properties. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
