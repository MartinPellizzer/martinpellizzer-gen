    "intro": "Dyckia mirandana, commonly known as the Mirandana grass, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of stiff, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often with a bluish-green or silver-gray hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy red or orange flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, Dyckia mirandana is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide."
