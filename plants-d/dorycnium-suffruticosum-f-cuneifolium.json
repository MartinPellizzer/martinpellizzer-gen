    "intro": "Dorycnium suffruticosum f. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr medic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a creeping rhizome and produces erect, branched stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers that appear in umbels, followed by distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This variety is notable for its morphological differences, particularly the elongated, cuneate leaflets that distinguish it from other forms of Dorycnium suffruticosum."
