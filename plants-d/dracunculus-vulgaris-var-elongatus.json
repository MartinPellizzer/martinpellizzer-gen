    "intro": "Dracunculus vulgaris var. elongatus, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking plant characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves and showy, white flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it is considered invasive. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, with a thick, hairy stem that exudes a sap containing phototoxic compounds. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and the flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands."
