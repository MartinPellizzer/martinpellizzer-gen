    "intro": "Desmodium aparines, commonly known as stickyweed or burr medic, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, hooked burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves and stems are covered in tiny, sticky glands that give the plant its common name. Desmodium aparines is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
