    "intro": "Delphinium angustipaniculatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved larkspur, is a tall perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, elongated racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
