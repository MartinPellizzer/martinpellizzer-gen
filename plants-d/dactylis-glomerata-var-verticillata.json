    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. verticillata, commonly known as the woolly cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the flowering spikes are arranged in a compact, cylindrical shape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings for forage."
