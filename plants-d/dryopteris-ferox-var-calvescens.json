    "intro": "Dryopteris ferox var. calvescens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a robust fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
