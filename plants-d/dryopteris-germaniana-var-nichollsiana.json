    "intro": "Dryopteris germaniana var. nichollsiana, commonly known as theNicholls' wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to the northeastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
