    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, pinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
