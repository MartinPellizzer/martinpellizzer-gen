    "intro": "Dillenia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower dillenia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dillenia parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
