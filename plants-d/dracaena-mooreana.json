    "intro": "Dracaena mooreana, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Dracaena mooreana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
