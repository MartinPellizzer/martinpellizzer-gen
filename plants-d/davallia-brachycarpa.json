    "intro": "Davallia brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
