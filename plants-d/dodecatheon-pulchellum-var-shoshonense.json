    "intro": "Dodecatheon pulchellum var. shoshonense, commonly known as the Shoshone glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching.
