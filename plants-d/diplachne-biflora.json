    "intro": "Diplachne biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two flowers per spikelet, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Diplachne biflora is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of early successional stages in ecological succession."
