    "intro": "Dipsacus ferox, commonly known as hog's garlic, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of spiky, red bracts that enclose small, pale yellow flowers. Its roots are tuberous and can be harvested for use in traditional herbal medicine. Dipsacus ferox is also known for its strong, garlic-like odor, which is released when the plant is crushed."
