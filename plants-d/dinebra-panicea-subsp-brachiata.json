It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often covered with bracts, giving it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
