    "intro": "Drosera penicillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sticky leaves covered in glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Drosera penicillaris is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
