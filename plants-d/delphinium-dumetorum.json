It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, with a somewhat hairy texture. Delphinium dumetorum is characterized by its showy flowers and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
