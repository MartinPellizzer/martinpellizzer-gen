    "intro": "Dalea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, cascading clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, hard, seed-like structures called elia seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Dalea peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
