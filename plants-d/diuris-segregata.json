    "intro": "Diuris segregata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spider-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is found in southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, growing in dry, sandy soils. It has a short-lived root system and relies on specific environmental conditions for successful germination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
