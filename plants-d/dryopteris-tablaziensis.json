    "intro": "Dryopteris tablaziensis, commonly known as the Tablazza shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
