    "intro": "Dyckia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Dyckia tuberosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
