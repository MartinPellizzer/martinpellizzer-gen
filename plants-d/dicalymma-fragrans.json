    "intro": "Dicalymma fragrans, commonly known as the sweet senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is noted for its fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms and aromatic properties."
