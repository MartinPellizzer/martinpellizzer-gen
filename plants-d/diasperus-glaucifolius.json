It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
