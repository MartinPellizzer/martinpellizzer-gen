    "intro": "Davallia brevisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hartiara, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia brevisora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
