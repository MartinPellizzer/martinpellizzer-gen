It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are edible, though often astringent when unripe, and are consumed by various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hard, dense wood used in traditional crafts and tool-making."
