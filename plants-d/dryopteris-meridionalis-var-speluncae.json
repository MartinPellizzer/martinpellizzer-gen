    "intro": "Dryopteris meridionalis var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, relying on moisture and mineral-rich substrates for nutrient uptake. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered an endangered species and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
