    "intro": "Derris elegans var. celebica, commonly known as the Celebes snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its climbing habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is notable for containing rotenone, a potent natural insecticide, which has been traditionally used in pest control. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
