    "intro": "Diaphananthe curvata, commonly known as the curved-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often curve gracefully. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are usually bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
