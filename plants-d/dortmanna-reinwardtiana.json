It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in brackish or freshwater environments along coastal regions. It has a low-growing habit and often forms dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecological balance in its habitat."
