    "intro": "Daucus muricatus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a variant of the sea holly that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, coastal substrates. The plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
