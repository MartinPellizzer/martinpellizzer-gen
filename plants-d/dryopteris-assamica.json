    "intro": "Dryopteris assamica, commonly known as the Assam shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northeastern regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
