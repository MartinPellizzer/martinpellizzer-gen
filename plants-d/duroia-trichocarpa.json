    "intro": "Duroia trichocarpa, commonly known as the arrow poison plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers and dark, glossy leaves. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, particularly the presence of curare-like alkaloids in its sap, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its growth habit includes climbing or shrub-like forms, often found in dense rainforest understories. Duroia trichocarpa plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
