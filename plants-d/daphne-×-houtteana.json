It features fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and are produced in clusters during late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
