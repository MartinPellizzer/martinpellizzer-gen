    "intro": "Dalea microphylla var. vicina, commonly known as the dwarf prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is closely related to other Dalea species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
