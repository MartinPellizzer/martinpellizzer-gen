    "intro": "Danthonia eriostoma, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Danthonia eriostoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
