    "intro": "Dendromyza microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its fronds are characterized by a finely divided structure, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. Dendromyza microphylla plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms."
