It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of soil fertility in certain ecosystems."
