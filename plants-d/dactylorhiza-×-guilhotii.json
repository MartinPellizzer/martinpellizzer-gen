    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 guilhotii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale to dark purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and woodland edges. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 guilhotii is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza lapponica."
