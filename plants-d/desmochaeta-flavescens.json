    "intro": "Desmochaeta flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered desmochaeta, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
