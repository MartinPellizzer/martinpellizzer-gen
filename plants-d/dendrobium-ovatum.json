    "intro": "Dendrobium ovatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a perennial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive golden hue. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium ovatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
