    "intro": "Dryopteris remotipinna, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
