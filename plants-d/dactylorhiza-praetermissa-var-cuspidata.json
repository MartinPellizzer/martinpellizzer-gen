It typically grows in damp, calcareous soils and thrives in environments with consistent moisture. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive, spurred lip. This orchid is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to bloom in late summer to early autumn."
