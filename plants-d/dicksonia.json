    "intro": "Dicksonia, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is native to various regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, and parts of South America. The plant's trunk is composed of a mass of roots and rhizomes, which provide structural support and store water. Dicksonia species typically have large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, and they reproduce via spores rather than seeds. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
