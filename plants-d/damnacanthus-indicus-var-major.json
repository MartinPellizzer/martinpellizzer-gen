It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure.
