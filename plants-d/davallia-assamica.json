    "intro": "Davallia assamica, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas. Davallia assamica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
