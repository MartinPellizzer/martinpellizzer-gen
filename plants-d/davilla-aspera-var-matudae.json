    "intro": "Davilla aspera var. matudae, commonly known as the Matudae roughleaf balsa, is a variant of the balsa tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its lightweight wood, it has been historically used in various crafts and construction."
