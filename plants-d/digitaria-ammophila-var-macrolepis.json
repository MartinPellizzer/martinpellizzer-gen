    "intro": "Digitaria ammophila var. macrolepis, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that stabilizes sand dunes and prevents erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
