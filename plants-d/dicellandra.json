    "intro": "Dicellandra, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers and are popular as ornamental plants. Dicellandra species typically have succulent leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are often grown in greenhouses or as houseplants due to their specific care requirements."
