    "intro": "Diplazium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged fronds that are typically bright green and lanceolate in shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Diplazium undulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
