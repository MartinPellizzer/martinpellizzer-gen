    "intro": "Dryopteris persimilis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. Its fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, needle-like pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
