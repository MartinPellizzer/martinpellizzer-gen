It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its growth and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that gives it a distinctive look. Doryopteris australiae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
