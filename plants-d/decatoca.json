It features large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks rising from water surfaces. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Decatoca is known for its symbolic significance in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and revered species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
