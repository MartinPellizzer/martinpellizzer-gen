    "intro": "Dioscorea tamarisciflora, commonly known as the tamarisk-flowered yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
