    "intro": "Drimia rupicola, commonly known as the rock drimia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Drimia rupicola is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
