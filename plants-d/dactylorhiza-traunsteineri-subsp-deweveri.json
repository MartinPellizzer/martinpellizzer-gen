    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. deweveri, commonly known as the Traunstein orchid, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip. It typically grows in wet, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
