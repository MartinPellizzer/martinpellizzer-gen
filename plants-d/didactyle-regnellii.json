It is characterized by its floating, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or barely above the water surface. Didactyle regnellii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
