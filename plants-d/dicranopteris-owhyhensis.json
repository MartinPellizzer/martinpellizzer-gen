It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris owhyhensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
