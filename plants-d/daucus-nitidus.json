    "intro": "Daucus nitidus, commonly known as the white carrot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in umbels. Its roots are typically thin and not as thick as those of the common carrot, but they are edible. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible greens."
