    "intro": "Decatoca spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's decatoca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Decatoca spenceri is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
