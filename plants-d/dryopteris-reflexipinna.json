    "intro": "Dryopteris reflexipinna, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features tall, arching fronds with a distinctive glossy, dark green color and a recurved (bent backward) pinnae structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
