    "intro": "Dendrobium litoreum, commonly known as the coastal dendrobium, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, sandy environments. Dendrobium litoreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal conditions."
