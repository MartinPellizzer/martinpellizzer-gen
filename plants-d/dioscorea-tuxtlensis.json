    "intro": "Dioscorea tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlans yam, is a species of tuberous plant native to the humid lowlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, tendril-bearing stems that ascend tree trunks or other supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by inedible, spiny fruits containing yellowish seeds. Its tubers, while not widely cultivated, have been used traditionally by local communities for food and medicinal purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
