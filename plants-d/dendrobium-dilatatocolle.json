It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive, broad lip that aids in pollination. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
