    "intro": "Dendranthema seticuspe, commonly known as the woolly fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, and somewhat fuzzy foliage, which gives it a unique texture. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
