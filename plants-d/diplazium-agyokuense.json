It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as streams and marshes, across parts of Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is notable for its adaptability to wetland conditions and its role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance."
