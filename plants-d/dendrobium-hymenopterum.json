    "intro": "Dendrobium hymenopterum, commonly known as the honeybee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium hymenopterum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
