    "intro": "Diplazium chocoense, commonly known as the Chocoan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are somewhat fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. Diplazium chocoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
