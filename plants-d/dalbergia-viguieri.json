    "intro": "Dalbergia viguieri, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
