    "intro": "Diploknema ramiflora, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in brackish water environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of coastal vegetation."
