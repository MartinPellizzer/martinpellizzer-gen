    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. sublatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features dark green, broad leaves and produces spikes of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive orchid shape. It is a rhizomatous species, with a network of underground stems that help it spread and survive in its wetland habitat. This orchid is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
