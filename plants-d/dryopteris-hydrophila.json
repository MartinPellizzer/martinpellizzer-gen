    "intro": "Dryopteris hydrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green and slightly curled. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to flourish in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
