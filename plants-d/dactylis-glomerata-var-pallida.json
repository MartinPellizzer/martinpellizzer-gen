    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. pallida, commonly known as pale crested dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pale green to silver-blue inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, and the plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
