    "intro": "Dodonaea submutica, commonly known as the silky oaks or silky acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland and forest environments. Dodonaea submutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some Indigenous Australian communities."
