    "intro": "Deyeuxia heterophylla var. puberilemma, commonly known as the hairy lemma sedge, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy lemma (bract) that covers the inflorescence, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
