    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. gaudinii, commonly known as Gaudin's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its slender, spike-like inflorescence bears small, two-lobed spikelets that are slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
