    "intro": "Dactylis nemorosa, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that grow in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. Dactylis nemorosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
