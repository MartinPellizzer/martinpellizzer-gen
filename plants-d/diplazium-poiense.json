    "intro": "Diplazium poiense, commonly known as the Pohnpei staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its native habitat. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting the plant's growth and helping it retain moisture. Diplazium poiense plays a significant ecological role in its environment, contributing to forest biodiversity and providing habitat for various small organisms."
