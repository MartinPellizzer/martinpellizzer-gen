    "intro": "Dioscorea tambillensis, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used as food in some regions. Its tubers are starchy and can be cooked like potatoes, though they contain toxic compounds that require proper preparation. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
