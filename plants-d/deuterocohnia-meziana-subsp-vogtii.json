    "intro": "Deuterocohnia meziana subsp. vogtii, commonly known as the Vogt's rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
