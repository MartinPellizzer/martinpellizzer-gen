    "intro": "Dactylis hispanica var. maritima, commonly known as sea dactylis, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
