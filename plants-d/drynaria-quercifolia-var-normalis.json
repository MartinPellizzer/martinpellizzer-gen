    "intro": "Drynaria quercifolia var. normalis, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to Asia. It features intricately lobed, oak-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
