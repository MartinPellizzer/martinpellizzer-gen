    "intro": "Deweya oligocarpa, commonly known as the Kashmiri walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing edible seeds. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with fissures that become more pronounced with age. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
