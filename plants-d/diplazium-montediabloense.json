    "intro": "Diplazium montediabloense, commonly known as the Diablo Mountain shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Sierra Diablo region of Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically smaller and more delicate than the sterile ones. Diplazium montediabloense thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
