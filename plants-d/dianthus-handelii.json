    "intro": "Dianthus handelii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
