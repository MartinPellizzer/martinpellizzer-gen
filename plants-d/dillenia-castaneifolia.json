    "intro": "Dillenia castaneifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which resemble the leaves of maple trees, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that split open to reveal seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. Dillenia castaneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically found in lowland forests or along riverbanks."
