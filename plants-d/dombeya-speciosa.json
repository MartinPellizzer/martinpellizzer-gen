    "intro": "Dombeya speciosa, commonly known as the showy dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are arranged in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Dombeya speciosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
