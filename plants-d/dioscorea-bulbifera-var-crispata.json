    "intro": "Dioscorea bulbifera var. crispata, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, bulbous stems that can store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible tubers that are rich in starch. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the varietal name \"crispata\" refers to the crinkled or wavy edges of its foliage. This species is often cultivated for its nutritional value and is also used in traditional medicine."
