    "intro": "Dalbergia microcarpa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
