    "intro": "Dendrochilum brevilabratum var. petiolatum, commonly known as the short-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation. This orchid is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
