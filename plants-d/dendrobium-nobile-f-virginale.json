    "intro": "Dendrobium nobile f. virginale, commonly known as the Virgin's Orchid, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The variety is prized for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
