    "intro": "Davallia pseudocystopteris, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
