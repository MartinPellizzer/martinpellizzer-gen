    "intro": "Dalbergia sissoides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant features bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and savannas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
