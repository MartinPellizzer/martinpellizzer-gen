    "intro": "Diplopogon, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, often evergreen foliage. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Cape Floristic Region. Diplopogon species are known for their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The genus is notable for its adaptability to nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
