    "intro": "Delphinium persicum var. assyriacum, commonly known as the Assyrian larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in tall, spires, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
