    "intro": "Dicliptera minor subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dicliptera, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and swampy areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly rolled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
