    "intro": "Dendrium prostratum, commonly known as the creeping cedar, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-like foliage. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, cylindrical cones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Dendrium prostratum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
