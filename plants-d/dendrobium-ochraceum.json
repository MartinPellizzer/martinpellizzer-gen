    "intro": "Dendrobium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is used to attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium ochraceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
