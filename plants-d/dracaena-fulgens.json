    "intro": "Dracaena fulgens, commonly known as the flame plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that are deep green with red or orange margins, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red berries. Dracaena fulgens thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
