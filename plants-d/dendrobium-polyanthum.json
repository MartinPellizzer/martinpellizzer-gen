    "intro": "Dendrobium polyanthum, commonly known as the orchid with many flowers, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a branched stem system that grows horizontally, often with aerial roots that absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and horticultural collections."
