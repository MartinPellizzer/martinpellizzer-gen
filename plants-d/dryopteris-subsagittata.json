    "intro": "Dryopteris subsagittata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into triangular segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
