    "intro": "Dryopteris basiaurita, commonly known as the broad-awned wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, broad, awn-like structure at the ends of the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
