    "intro": "Delphinium emarginatum, commonly known as the fringed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers with distinctive fringed petals. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Delphinium emarginatum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to livestock and humans."
