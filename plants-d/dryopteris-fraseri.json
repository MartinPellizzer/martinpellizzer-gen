    "intro": "Dryopteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The Fraser fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
