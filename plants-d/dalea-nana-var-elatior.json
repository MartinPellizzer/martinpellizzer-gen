    "intro": "Dalea nana var. elatior, commonly known as the tall dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid regions. This variety is distinguished from other Dalea species by its increased height and more elongated inflorescences."
