    "intro": "Dactylorhiza insularis f. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a few lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a single or few flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
