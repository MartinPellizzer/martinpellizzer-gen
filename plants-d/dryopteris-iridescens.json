    "intro": "Dryopteris iridescens, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that have a distinctive iridescent sheen when exposed to light. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
