    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. remota, commonly known as the remote lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in a loose, lateral raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous root system and is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
