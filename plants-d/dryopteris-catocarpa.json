    "intro": "Dryopteris catocarpa, commonly known as the red wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
