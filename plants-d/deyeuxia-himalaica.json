    "intro": "Deyeuxia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows and stream banks, and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Deyeuxia himalaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
