    "intro": "Diplazium cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Diplazium cordifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover."
