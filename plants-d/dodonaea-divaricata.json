    "intro": "Dodonaea divaricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
