    "intro": "Declieuxia alba, commonly known as the white flax or white flaxgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in loose panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous stalks are used in traditional basket-making and as a source of fiber. Declieuxia alba thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and coastal habitats."
