    "intro": "Diplazium oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard's spleenwort, is a member of the Hymenophyllum family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, aiding in moisture retention. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Diplazium oellgaardii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
