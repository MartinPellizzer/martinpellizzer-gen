    "intro": "Dryas tenella, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and subalpine zones. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
