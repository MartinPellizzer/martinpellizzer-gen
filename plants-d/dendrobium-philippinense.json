    "intro": "Dendrobium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
