    "intro": "Desmodium pilosum, commonly known as hairy desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
