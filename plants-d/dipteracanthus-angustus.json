    "intro": "Dipteracanthus angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tree species found in rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
