    "intro": "Dolichos daltonii, commonly known as the Dalton's horsegram, is a leguminous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Dolichos daltonii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial crop in sustainable agriculture."
