    "intro": "Daemonorops korthalsii, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
