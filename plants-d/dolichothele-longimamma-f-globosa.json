    "intro": "Dolichothele longimamma f. globosa, commonly known as the globular grass spider, is a unique variant of the long-bodied grass spider. It is characterized by its rounded, globular body shape, which distinguishes it from the typical elongated form of its species. The plant is not a true plant but a spider, belonging to the family Linyphiidae, and is found in grassy habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to pollination and serving as prey for larger animals. Its botanical study is important for understanding the diversity of arachnids in grassland environments."
