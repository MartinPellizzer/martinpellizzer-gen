    "intro": "Draba frigida var. laevipes, commonly known as the glabrous frostweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette of tightly packed, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme climates."
