It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems that twine around supports. The leaves are trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets and short, curved teeth along the margins. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, clustered in axillary racemes, and the pods are slender, containing several oval seeds.
