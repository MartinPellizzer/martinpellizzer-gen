It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has slender, often woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Dodonaea ptarmicifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
