    "intro": "Dryopteris decumbens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that spread horizontally along the ground. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
