It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bicolor flowers that typically feature pink and white petals. The plant produces a distinctive scent, which is more pronounced in cooler temperatures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
