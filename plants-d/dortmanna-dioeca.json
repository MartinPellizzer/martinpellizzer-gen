    "intro": "Dortmanna dioeca, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single leaf and produces two distinct flowers, one on each side of the stem. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Dortmanna dioeca is considered endangered in many regions, highlighting the need for its protection."
