    "intro": "Delphinium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal and lanceolate, with a rough texture and a strong, often unpleasant aroma. Delphinium glaciale is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
