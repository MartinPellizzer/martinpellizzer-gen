It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The species is noted for its spiny structures, which provide some degree of defense against herbivores."
