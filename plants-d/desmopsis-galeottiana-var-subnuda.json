    "intro": "Desmopsis galeottiana var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked desmopsis, is a species native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
