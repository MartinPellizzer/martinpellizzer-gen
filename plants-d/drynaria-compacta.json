    "intro": "Drynaria compacta, commonly known as the compact tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern around the trunk. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and absorb moisture. Drynaria compacta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
