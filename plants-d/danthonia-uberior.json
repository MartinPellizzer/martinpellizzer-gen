    "intro": "Danthonia uberior, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions. Danthonia uberior plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
