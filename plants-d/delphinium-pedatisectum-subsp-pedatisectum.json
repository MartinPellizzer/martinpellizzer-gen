    "intro": "Delphinium pedatisectum subsp. pedatisectum, commonly known as the cut-leaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a bird's foot, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
