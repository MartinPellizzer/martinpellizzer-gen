    "intro": "Drosanthemum exspersum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
