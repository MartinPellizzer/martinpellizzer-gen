It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and has tendrils that help it climb. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The tubers of Dioscorea spongiosa are valued for their medicinal properties and are sometimes used as a food source."
