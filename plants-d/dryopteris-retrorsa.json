    "intro": "Dryopteris retrorsa, commonly known as the reverse fern, is a species of fern native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that curve backward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves, or fronds, are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Dryopteris retrorsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
