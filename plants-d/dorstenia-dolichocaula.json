    "intro": "Dorstenia dolichocaula, commonly known as the long-stemmed dwarf cucumber, is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, edible fruits that resemble cucumbers. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and challenging plant to cultivate."
