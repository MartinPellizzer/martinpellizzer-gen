    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 sardoa, commonly known as the Sardonic fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomera. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in two rows on the underside of the fronds. The Sardonic fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
