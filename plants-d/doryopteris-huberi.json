    "intro": "Doryopteris huberi, commonly known as the Hawaiian cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky cliffs and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris huberi plays an important ecological role in the unique ecosystems of Hawaii."
