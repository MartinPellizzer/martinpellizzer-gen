It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, stubbier roots compared to the standard carrot. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. This variety is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and compact size."
