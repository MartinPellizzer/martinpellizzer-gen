    "intro": "Deparia subsimilis, commonly known as the similar wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy underside. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through underground stems. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fronds."
