    "intro": "Dorstenia ophiocoma var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spider plant, is a unique member of the family Malvaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a spider's web. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in a helical pattern along the stem. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy texture. This varietal form is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and visual appeal."
