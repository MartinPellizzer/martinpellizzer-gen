    "intro": "Drozia macrocephala, commonly known as the giant drozia, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, making it a standout in its native habitat. The plant produces vibrant, often purple or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its environment. Drozia macrocephala is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
