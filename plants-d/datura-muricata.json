    "intro": "Datura muricata, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has spiny stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. Datura muricata contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
