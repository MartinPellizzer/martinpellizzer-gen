    "intro": "Drynaria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of luciferin. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular plant in horticulture."
