    "intro": "Delissea holophylla var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed delissea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its obovate, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species in the wild."
