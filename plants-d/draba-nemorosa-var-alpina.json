    "intro": "Draba nemorosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine winter grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Draba nemorosa var. alpina plays a vital role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems and is an indicator species for mountainous habitats."
