    "intro": "Dolichandra cynanchoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Dolichandra cynanchoides is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
