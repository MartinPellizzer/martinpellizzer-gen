    "intro": "Dryopteris trichophora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
