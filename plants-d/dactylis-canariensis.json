    "intro": "Dactylis canariensis, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Dactylis canariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
