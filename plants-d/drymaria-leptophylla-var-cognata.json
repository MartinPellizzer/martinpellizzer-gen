    "intro": "Drymaria leptophylla var. cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control."
