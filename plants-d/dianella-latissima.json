    "intro": "Dianella latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved flax lily, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are broad and often waxy in texture. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Dianella latissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage and flowering display."
