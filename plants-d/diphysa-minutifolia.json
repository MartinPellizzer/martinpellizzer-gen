    "intro": "Diphysa minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf diphysa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
