    "intro": "Daucus communis proles maritimus, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to salty and windy environments. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots are usually smaller and less fleshy compared to the cultivated carrot, but they are often used in traditional herbal remedies. This species is valued for its resilience and potential genetic contributions to agricultural breeding programs."
