    "intro": "Dentaria integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are smooth and entire, with a slightly hairy stem that bears small, white, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and blooms from May to July. Its flowering heads are composed of many tiny tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
