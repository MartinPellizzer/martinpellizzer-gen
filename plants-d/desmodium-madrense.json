    "intro": "Desmodium madrense, commonly known as Mexican velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, elliptical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Desmodium madrense is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings."
