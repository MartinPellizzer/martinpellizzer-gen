    "intro": "Danthonia melanathera, commonly known as black-leafed hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Danthonia melanathera is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in wetland restoration projects."
