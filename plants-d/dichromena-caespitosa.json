    "intro": "Dichromena caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted dichromena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is a dense spike that rises from the center of the rosette, making it visually distinctive. Dichromena caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
