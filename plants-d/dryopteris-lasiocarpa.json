    "intro": "Dryopteris lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
