    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan Dodonaea, is a shrub native to the islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and limestone habitats, often forming dense thickets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
