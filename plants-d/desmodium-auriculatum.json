    "intro": "Desmodium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Desmodium auriculatum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
