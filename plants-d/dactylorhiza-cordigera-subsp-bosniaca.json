It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as peat bogs and marshes. Its rhizome system allows it to store nutrients and moisture, aiding survival in its often harsh environment."
