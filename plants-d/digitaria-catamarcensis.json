    "intro": "Digitaria catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarcensis Digitaria, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
