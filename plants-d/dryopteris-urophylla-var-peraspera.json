    "intro": "Dryopteris urophylla var. peraspera, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to East Asia. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its deeply lobed, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive, rugged texture."
