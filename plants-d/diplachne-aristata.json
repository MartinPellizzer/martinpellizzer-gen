    "intro": "Diplachne aristata, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, ascending inflorescences. Diplachne aristata thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
