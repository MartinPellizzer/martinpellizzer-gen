    "intro": "Didimeria, commonly known as the false sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs, characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Didimeria species are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and contribute to pollinator habitats."
