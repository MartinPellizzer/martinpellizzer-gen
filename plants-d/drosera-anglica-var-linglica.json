    "intro": "Drosera anglica var. linglica, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pink, adding to its ornamental appeal."
