    "intro": "Dendrobium bougainvilleanum, commonly known as the Bougainvillean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking clusters of vibrant, papery bracts that range in color from pink to purple, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. Its flowering period typically occurs during the dry season, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
