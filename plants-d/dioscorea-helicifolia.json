It features a robust, tuberous root system that is often harvested for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomes contain compounds such as diosgenin, which have been studied for their potential health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories."
