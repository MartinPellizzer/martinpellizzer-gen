It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to a range of soil types. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
