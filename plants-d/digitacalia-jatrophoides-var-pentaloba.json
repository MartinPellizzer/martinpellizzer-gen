    "intro": "Digitacalia jatrophoides var. pentaloba, commonly known as the five-lobed bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is notable for its inflated, bladder-like pods that enclose its seeds. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and has small, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and produce small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind."
