    "intro": "Delarbrea montana subsp. arborea, commonly known as the mountain delarbrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing some resistance to frost and drought. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
