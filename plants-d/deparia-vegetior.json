    "intro": "Deparia vegetior, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
