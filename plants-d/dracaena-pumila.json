It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Dracaena pumila thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor gardening."
