    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeata var. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's shield fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
