    "intro": "Dendrobium crepidatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red or purple markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium crepidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
