    "intro": "Diplycosia rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its wood is valued for its unique scent and is used in traditional medicine and perfumery. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
