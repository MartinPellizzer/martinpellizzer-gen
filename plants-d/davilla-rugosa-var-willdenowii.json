    "intro": "Davilla rugosa var. willdenowii, commonly known as the willdenow's beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright purple, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. These fruits are edible for some animals but are generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
