    "intro": "Diplazium prolixum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in horticulture."
