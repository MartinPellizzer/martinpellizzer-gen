    "intro": "Distephana glandulosa var. canaliculata, commonly known as the canyon sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky crevices effectively. Its leaves are often covered with tiny, glandular structures that secrete oils, which may help in water retention and defense against herbivores. This variety is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
