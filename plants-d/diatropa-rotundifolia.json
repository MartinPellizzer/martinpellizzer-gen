    "intro": "Diatropa rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf diatropa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive appearance."
