    "intro": "Didymopanax vinosus var. attenuatus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and often has a reddish-brown color, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall in its natural habitat. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
