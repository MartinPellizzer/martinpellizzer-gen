    "intro": "Dactyloctenium perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's fingergrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the ground. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in disturbed or open habitats."
