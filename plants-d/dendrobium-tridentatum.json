It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant has a unique morphology with a tall, upright stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium tridentatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
