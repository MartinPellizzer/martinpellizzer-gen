    "intro": "Draba dendroides, commonly known as the tree draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushion-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, oblanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba dendroides is adapted to harsh alpine environments, showing resilience to cold and arid conditions."
