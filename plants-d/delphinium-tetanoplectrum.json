    "intro": "Delphinium tetanoplectrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
