    "intro": "Dichrostachys, commonly known as the sicklepod or flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often red or orange, flower clusters that resemble flames. Dichrostachys species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in dry or semi-arid environments. They have a woody stem and produce pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
