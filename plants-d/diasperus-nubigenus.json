It is native to high-altitude regions and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves contain milky sap, a feature common among the Euphorbiaceae family. Diasperus nubigenus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
