    "intro": "Dalbergia tinnevelliensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
