    "intro": "Dialanthera glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its glandular surfaces secrete a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores and aid in water retention. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
