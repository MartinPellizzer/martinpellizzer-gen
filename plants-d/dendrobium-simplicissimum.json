    "intro": "Dendrobium simplicissimum, commonly known as the simple dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium simplicissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
