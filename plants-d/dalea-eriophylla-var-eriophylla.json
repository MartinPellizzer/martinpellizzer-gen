It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a compact, low-growing structure. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
