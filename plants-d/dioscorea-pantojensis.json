    "intro": "Dioscorea pantojensis, commonly known as the Pantoja yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions of Mexico and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, valued for their nutritional content and traditional medicinal uses. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
