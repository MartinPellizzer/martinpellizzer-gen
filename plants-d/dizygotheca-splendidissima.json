It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, green bark and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are zygomorphic, meaning they are bilaterally symmetrical, with distinct sepals and petals. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral display."
