It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in high-altitude flora."
