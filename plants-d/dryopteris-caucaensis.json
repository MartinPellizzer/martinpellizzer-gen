    "intro": "Dryopteris caucaensis, commonly known as the Cauca wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and montane habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
