    "intro": "Diplazium trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its feathery, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Diplazium trinitense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its tropical habitat, with a rhizomatous growth system that allows for vegetative propagation."
