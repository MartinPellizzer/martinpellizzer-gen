    "intro": "Draba lactea var. nidificans, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh mountain climates. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants."
