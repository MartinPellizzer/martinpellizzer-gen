    "intro": "Dryopteris parallelogramma, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Dryopteris parallelogramma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
