    "intro": "Diplazium latisquamatum, commonly known as the broad-scaled chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae with broad, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in moist soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
