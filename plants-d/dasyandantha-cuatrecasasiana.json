    "intro": "Dasyandantha cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine plant ecology and adaptation."
