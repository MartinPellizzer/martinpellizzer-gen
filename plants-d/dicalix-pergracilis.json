    "intro": "Dicalix pergracilis, commonly known as the slender dicalix, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
