    "intro": "Digitaria leptalea, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. Digitaria leptalea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
