    "intro": "Daviesia intricata, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Daviesia intricata is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
