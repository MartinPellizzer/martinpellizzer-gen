    "intro": "Dicksonia abrupta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome, which stores water and nutrients. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime photosynthesis. Dicksonia abrupta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
