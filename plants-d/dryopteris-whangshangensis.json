    "intro": "Dryopteris whangshangensis, commonly known as the Whangshang wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access adequate humidity and light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
