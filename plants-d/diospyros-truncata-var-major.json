    "intro": "Diospyros truncata var. major, commonly known as the large-leafed persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red, fleshy fruits with a sweet, astringent flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon varieties."
