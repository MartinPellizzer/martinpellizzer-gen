    "intro": "Dichanthelium microcarpon, commonly known as the littleseed panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Dichanthelium microcarpon plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
