    "intro": "Dasysphaera breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
