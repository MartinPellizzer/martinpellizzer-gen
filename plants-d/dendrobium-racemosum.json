    "intro": "Dendrobium racemosum, commonly known as the racemose orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is an epiphytic or lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental beauty and use in traditional medicine."
