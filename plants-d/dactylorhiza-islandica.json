It is a herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems bearing a single spike of flowers. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. The plant is listed as endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
