    "intro": "Dontostemon dentatus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular-leafed sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and succulent, glandular-dotted leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, sticky hairs, which contribute to its drought tolerance. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
