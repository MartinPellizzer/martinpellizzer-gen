It is characterized by its dark purple to black speckled petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. Its flowers bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
