It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and manageable size, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
