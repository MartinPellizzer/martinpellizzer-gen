    "intro": "Decaspermum teretis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved decaspermum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Decaspermum teretis is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
