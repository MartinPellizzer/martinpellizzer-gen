    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a delicate appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
