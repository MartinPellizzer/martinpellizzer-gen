    "intro": "Draba verna var. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptical, glaucous leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It blooms early in the spring, typically from March to May, before the snow has fully melted. Draba verna var. rubella is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds."
