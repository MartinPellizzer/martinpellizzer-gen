It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its dense root system. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
