    "intro": "Dela, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dela is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for small spaces and decorative arrangements."
