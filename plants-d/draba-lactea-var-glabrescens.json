    "intro": "Draba lactea var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that becomes smoother as it matures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
