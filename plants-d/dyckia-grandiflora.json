    "intro": "Dyckia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, violet to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
