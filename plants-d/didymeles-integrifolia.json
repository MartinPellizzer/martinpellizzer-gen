    "intro": "Didymeles integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved didymeles, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically smooth and glossy in texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Didymeles integrifolia is often found in shaded understory environments within its natural habitat."
