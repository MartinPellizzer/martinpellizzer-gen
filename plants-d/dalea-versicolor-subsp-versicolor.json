    "intro": "Dalea versicolor subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its subspecies status reflects its variability in flower color and leaf morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
