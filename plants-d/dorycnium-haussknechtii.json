    "intro": "Dorycnium haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknecht's sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. Dorycnium haussknechtii is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in forage systems in arid environments."
