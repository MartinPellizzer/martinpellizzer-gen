    "intro": "Diplacus brevipes, commonly known as the shortstem monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Diplacus brevipes is an important species for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
