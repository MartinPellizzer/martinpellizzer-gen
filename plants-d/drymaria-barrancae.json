    "intro": "Drymaria barrancae, commonly known as the canyon sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants adapted to dry environments. The plant features wiry stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Drymaria barrancae thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in canyon bottoms and washes."
