It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring. The species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
