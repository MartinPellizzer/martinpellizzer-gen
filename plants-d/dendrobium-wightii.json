    "intro": "Dendrobium wightii, commonly known as the Wight's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium wightii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
