    "intro": "Donacodes incarnata, commonly known as the red swamp crayfish plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
