It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other species known for their hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by small, round fruits that ripen to a yellow or orange hue. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its timber, which is used in traditional crafts and construction due to its strength and resistance to decay."
