    "intro": "Deweya vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
