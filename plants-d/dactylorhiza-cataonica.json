    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cataonica, commonly known as the Scottish bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the UK and parts of northern Europe. It thrives in acidic, peaty habitats such as bogs and heaths, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, showy spike of pink or purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil, a characteristic common in orchids. Dactylorhiza cataonica is protected in some regions due to its declining populations and habitat loss."
