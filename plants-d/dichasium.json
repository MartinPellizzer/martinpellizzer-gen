    "intro": "Dichasium, commonly known as the two-branched flower, is a type of inflorescence found in certain flowering plants. It consists of two opposite branches, each bearing a cluster of flowers. This structure is characteristic of some species within the family Malvaceae. The dichasium arrangement allows for efficient pollination by increasing the visibility and accessibility of the flowers. Botanically, it is an important feature in the classification and study of plant morphology."
