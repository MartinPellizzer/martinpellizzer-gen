    "intro": "Dilivaria scandens, commonly known as the climbing honeysuckle, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a red color, often consumed by birds and other wildlife."
