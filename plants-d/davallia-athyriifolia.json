It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions like India and Malaysia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping stem that produces new plantlets at the nodes. Its leaves are leathery and can grow up to several feet in length, often with a curled, protective base resembling a bird's nest. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
