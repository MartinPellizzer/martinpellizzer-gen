    "intro": "Dryopteris pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
