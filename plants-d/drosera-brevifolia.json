    "intro": "Drosera brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually short and broad, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. Drosera brevifolia is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
