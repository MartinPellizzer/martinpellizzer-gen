    "intro": "Dryopteris macrostegia, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in a variety of soil conditions."
