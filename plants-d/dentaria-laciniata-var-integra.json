It features basal leaves that are smooth and entire, with a slightly hairy texture, and upright stems that bear small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodlands or along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its flowers are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
