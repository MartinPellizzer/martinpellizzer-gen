    "intro": "Deschampsia hispanica subsp. gredensis, commonly known as the Gredense bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
