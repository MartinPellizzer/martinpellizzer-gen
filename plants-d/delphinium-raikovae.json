    "intro": "Delphinium raikovae, commonly known as the Raikovae larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
