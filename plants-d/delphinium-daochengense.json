    "intro": "Delphinium daochengense, commonly known as the Daocheng larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which come in shades of blue, purple, and white, are a key feature in its ecological role and ornamental value. Delphinium daochengense is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
