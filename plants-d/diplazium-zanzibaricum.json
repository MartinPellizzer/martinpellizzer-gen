    "intro": "Diplazium zanzibaricum, commonly known as Zanzibar water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Diplazium zanzibaricum plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
