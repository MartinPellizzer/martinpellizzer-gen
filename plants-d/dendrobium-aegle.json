    "intro": "Dendrobium aegle, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive golden hue, and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Dendrobium aegle has lance-shaped leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients."
