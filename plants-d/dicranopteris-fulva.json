    "intro": "Dicranopteris fulva, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Dicranopteris fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
