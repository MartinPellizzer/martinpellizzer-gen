    "intro": "Desmodium nuttallii, commonly known as hairy desmodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a shallow root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
