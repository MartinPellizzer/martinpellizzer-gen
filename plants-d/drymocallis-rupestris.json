    "intro": "Drymocallis rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
