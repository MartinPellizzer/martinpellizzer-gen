    "intro": "Diastatea micrantha var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed diastatea, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its slender, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces a latex-like substance when the stems are broken. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
