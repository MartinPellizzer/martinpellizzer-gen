    "intro": "Dendrobium fuligineum, commonly known as the sooty orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a dark, sooty appearance, which gives it its common name. Dendrobium fuligineum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
