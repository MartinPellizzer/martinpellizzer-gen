    "intro": "Daucus communis, commonly known as wild carrot, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that resemble those of cultivated carrots. The plant produces small, round fruits called mericarps, which are often used as a spice in some cuisines. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its similarity to cultivated carrots, it can be mistaken for edible varieties, though it is generally considered non-toxic but not particularly palatable."
