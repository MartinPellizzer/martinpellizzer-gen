    "intro": "Dendrobium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient water absorption from the air. Dendrobium fimbriatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
