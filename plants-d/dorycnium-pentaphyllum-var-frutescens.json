    "intro": "Dorycnium pentaphyllum var. frutescens, commonly known as the creeping cow-vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
