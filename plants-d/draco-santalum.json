    "intro": "Draco santalum, commonly known as the gum tree or Indian sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which contains high levels of sesquiterpene lactones. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds."
