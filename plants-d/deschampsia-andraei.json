    "intro": "Deschampsia andraei, commonly known as the Andraei feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that produce feathery inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Deschampsia genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its adaptability to harsh climates, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in similar environments."
