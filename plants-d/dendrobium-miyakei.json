    "intro": "Dendrobium miyakei, commonly known as the Miyake orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Dendrobium miyakei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
