    "intro": "Dryopteris praetervisa, commonly known as the purple sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features fronds that are typically slender and sword-shaped, with a distinctive purple hue on the underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
