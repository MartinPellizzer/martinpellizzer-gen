    "intro": "Dracophyllum pronum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Dracophyllum pronum is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
