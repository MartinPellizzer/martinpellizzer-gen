    "intro": "Desmodium velutinum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its hairy stems and leaves give it a velvety appearance. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
