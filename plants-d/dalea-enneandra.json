    "intro": "Dalea enneandra, commonly known as the nine-leaf Dalea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of nine small leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. Dalea enneandra is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
