    "intro": "Davallia sinensis, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow close to the soil surface, forming dense clusters. Davallia sinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor settings."
