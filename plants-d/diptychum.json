It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Its leaves are generally basal, alternate, and have a rough texture. Diptychum species are known for their ability to thrive in disturbed soils and are often considered weeds in agricultural settings."
