    "intro": "Drosera minutula, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tiny, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually less than 10 millimeters in length, and it produces small, white flowers during the spring. Drosera minutula is a member of the Droseraceae family and is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils."
