    "intro": "Dryopsila, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often clustered leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Dryopsila species are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
