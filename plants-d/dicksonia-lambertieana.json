    "intro": "Dicksonia lambertieana, commonly known as the Lambertie's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of bright green, pinnate fronds that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps retain moisture and provides structural support."
