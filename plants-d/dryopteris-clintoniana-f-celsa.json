    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana f. celsa, commonly known as the Clintonian wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
