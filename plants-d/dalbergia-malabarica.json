It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich grain patterns. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically ranging from 7 to 15. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
