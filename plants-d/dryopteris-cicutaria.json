    "intro": "Dryopteris cicutaria, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
