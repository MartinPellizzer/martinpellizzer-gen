    "intro": "Dianella sparsiflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered flax lily, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, forming a dense clump. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers on spikes that rise above the foliage in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form attractive ground covers in shaded gardens."
