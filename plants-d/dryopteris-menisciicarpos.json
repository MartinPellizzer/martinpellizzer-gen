    "intro": "Dryopteris menisciicarpos, commonly known as the Menisciform Shield Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a broad, fan-like appearance. The plant is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to colonize rocky or forested areas. The spores are released from small, clustered sorangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
