It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Terminalia and Ficus species. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or orange in color and serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
