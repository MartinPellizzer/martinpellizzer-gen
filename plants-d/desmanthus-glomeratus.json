    "intro": "Desmanthus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
