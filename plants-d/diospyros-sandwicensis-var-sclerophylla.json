    "intro": "Diospyros sandwicensis var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the Koa \u2018Ola or Koa \u2018Ola, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, dark bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange to red fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
