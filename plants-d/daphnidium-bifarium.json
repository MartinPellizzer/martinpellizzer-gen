    "intro": "Daphnidium bifarium, commonly known as the twin-leaf water clover, is a rare aquatic plant found in specific freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Daphnidium bifarium is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
