It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that resemble torches, blooming in summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, growing along the stems. Dendrobium ardenii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
