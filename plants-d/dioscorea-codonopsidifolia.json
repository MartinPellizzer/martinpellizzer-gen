    "intro": "Dioscorea codonopsidifolia, commonly known as the Indian yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant has compound leaves with lanceolate or ovate leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual. Its tubers, which can be large and fleshy, are an important part of its botanical significance in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
