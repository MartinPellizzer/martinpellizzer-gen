It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
