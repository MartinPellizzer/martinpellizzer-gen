    "intro": "Dalbergia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and beauty, though it is also listed as vulnerable due to overharvesting. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
