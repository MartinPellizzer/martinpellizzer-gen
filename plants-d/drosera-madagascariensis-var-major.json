    "intro": "Drosera madagascariensis var. major, commonly known as the giant Madagascan sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, sticky leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth. This variant is notable for its size and is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
