    "intro": "Dioscorea hexagona, commonly known as the yam vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its hexagonal-shaped stems and heart-shaped leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, valued for their nutritional content and traditional medicinal properties. Dioscorea hexagona is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet, nutty flavor."
