    "intro": "Davallia macgillivrayi, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery-veined pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
