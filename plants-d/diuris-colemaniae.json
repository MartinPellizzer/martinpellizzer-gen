    "intro": "Diuris colemaniae, commonly known as the Crimson Rock Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It features a compact, hairy rhizome with a single, erect, grass-like leaf. The plant produces a spike of 5\u201310 bright red or orange-red flowers, each with a distinctive, spurred labellum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
