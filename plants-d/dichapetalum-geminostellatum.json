    "intro": "Dichapetalum geminostellatum, commonly known as the twin-star flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
