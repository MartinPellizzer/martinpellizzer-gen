    "intro": "Dichondra carolinensis, commonly known as mother-of-thousands, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
