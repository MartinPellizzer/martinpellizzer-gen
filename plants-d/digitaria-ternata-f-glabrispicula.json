    "intro": "Digitaria ternata f. glabrispicula, commonly known as the smooth-spike fingergrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely packed and covered with short, hairless bracts. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) lemma and palea, which give it a distinct appearance compared to other Digitaria species. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils."
