    "intro": "Dracaena intermedia, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena intermedia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
