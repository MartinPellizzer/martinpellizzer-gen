    "intro": "Dodonaea calycina var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand coastal conditions."
