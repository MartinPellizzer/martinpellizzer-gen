    "intro": "Desmoscelis villosa var. ovata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The plant has finely divided, thread-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and are borne on short stems. This variant is notable for its specialized adaptations for both aquatic life and carnivorous feeding."
