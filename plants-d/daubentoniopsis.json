    "intro": "Daubentoniopsis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plants typically grow as compact shrubs or herbs, often with a rosette-like arrangement of leaves. Daubentoniopsis species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flower colors and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
