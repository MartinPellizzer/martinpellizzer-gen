    "intro": "Dendrobium nobile virginale, commonly known as the orchid of the mountains, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of long, pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, showy flowers. The plant has fleshy, often hairy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a lip that is often yellow or orange. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
