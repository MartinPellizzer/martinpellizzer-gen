The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Dendrophthora thomasii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees and contributes to biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
