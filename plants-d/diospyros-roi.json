    "intro": "Diospyros roi, commonly known as the Roi persimmon, is a species native to the island of Roi-Namur in the Caroline Islands. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fruit that matures to a deep orange-red color. The fruit has a sweet, honey-like flavor when fully ripe and is often consumed fresh or used in local traditional dishes. Diospyros roi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in the region."
