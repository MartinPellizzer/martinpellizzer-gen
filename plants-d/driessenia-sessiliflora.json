    "intro": "Driessenia sessiliflora, commonly known as the Mexican cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, succulent structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
