    "intro": "Dyckia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf dyckia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. Dyckia pumila is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
