    "intro": "Draba macleanii, commonly known as MacLean's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single umbel. Draba macleanii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
