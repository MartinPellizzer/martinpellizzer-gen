    "intro": "Doniophyton andicola, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. It has adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a valuable species for studying plant adaptation in alpine ecosystems."
