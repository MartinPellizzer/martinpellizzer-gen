    "intro": "Dalbergia zeylanica, commonly known as Sri Lankan rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Sri Lanka and southern India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces dark-colored, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
