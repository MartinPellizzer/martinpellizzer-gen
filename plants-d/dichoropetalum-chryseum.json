It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits dichogamy, a reproductive strategy where the male and female reproductive organs mature at different times. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive golden hue that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
