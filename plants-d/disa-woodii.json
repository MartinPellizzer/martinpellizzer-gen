    "intro": "Disa woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, grass-like leaves and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Disa woodii is considered critically endangered."
