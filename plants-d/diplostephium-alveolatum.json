    "intro": "Diplostephium alveolatum, commonly known as the honeycomb cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant features a unique arrangement of areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
