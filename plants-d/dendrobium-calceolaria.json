    "intro": "Dendrobium calceolaria, commonly known as the wax lip orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique shape resembling a small cup or bowl, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Dendrobium calceolaria is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
