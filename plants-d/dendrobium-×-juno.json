It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often arranged in clusters. Its stems are typically erect and can grow up to several feet in height. Dendrobium \u00d7 juno requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
