    "intro": "Dieteria coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It often grows in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its distinctive appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
