    "intro": "Delphinium kolymense, commonly known as the Kolyma larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia and Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid surroundings. Delphinium kolymense is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking floral display during the short summer season."
