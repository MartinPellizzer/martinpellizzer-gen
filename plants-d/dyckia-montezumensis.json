    "intro": "Dyckia montezumensis, commonly known as the Mexican feather plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Dyckia montezumensis is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
