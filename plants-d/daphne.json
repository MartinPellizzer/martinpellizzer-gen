    "intro": "Daphne, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Thymelaeaceae. These plants are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and they are characterized by their fragrant, often tubular flowers. Daphne species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy blooms in shades of pink, white, and red. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are popular in gardens for their winter flowering habit. However, they are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling them."
