    "intro": "Dianthus rupicola, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, pink or red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Dianthus rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
