    "intro": "Daviesia divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hop bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and narrow, ovate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Daviesia divaricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
