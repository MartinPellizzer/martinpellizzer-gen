    "intro": "Drosera indica, commonly known as the Indian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has a rosette structure with broad, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often in shades of pink or red. Drosera indica is notable for its ability to digest captured prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
