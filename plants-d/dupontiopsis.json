    "intro": "Dupontiopsis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its unique, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Dupontiopsis species are often found in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing their adaptability to arid conditions. Due to habitat loss, many species within this genus are considered threatened or endangered."
