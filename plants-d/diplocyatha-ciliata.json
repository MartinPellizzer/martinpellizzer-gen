It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, ciliate (fringed) segments, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Diplocyatha ciliata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
