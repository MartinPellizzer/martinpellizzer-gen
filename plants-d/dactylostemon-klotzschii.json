    "intro": "Dactylostemon klotzschii, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance through its succulent leaves. Dactylostemon klotzschii is often found in open woodlands and is a common component of native plant communities in its range."
