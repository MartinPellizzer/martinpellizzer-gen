    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. pseudorigida, commonly known as the hard fern, is a robust fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing sporangia are clustered in circular sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family."
