    "intro": "Diasperus depressus, commonly known as the flat sandbur, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, spiny fruits that detach easily from the plant, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming in early spring before the plant sets seed."
