    "intro": "Dryopteris diversifolia, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that vary in size and shape, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
