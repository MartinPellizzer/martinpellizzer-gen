    "intro": "Dracula venosa, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique photosynthetic epiphyte. Dracula venosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its beauty and rarity have made it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
