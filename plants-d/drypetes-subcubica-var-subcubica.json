    "intro": "Drypetes subcubica var. subcubica, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hard wood and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
