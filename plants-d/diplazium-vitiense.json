    "intro": "Diplazium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing sporangia on the undersides. Diplazium vitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
