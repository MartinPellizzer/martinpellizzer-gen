    "intro": "Diplolepis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved dewflower, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its foliage is adapted to thrive in partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in woodland settings. The thick leaves provide structural support and help reduce water loss, contributing to its resilience in diverse environmental conditions."
