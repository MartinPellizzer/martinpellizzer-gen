    "intro": "Desmodium viride, commonly known as green burr clover, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Desmodium viride is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
