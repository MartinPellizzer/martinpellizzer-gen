    "intro": "Diospyros lotus f. globosa, commonly known as the globe persimmon, is a compact, shrub-like form of the persimmon plant native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to reddish fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruits are generally smaller and more spherical than those of the standard species, with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and edible fruits."
