    "intro": "Dichrospermum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species found in Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands. The plants are characterized by their showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. Dichrospermum species are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, with smooth, often greyish bark and alternate, simple leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly cultivated in gardens and as street trees in warmer climates."
