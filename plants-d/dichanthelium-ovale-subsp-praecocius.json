    "intro": "Dichanthelium ovale subsp. praecocius, commonly known as the early oval panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Its flowering occurs early in the growing season, usually in spring, and it is characterized by its small, pale-green to brownish flowers. This subspecies is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
