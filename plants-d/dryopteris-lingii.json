    "intro": "Dryopteris lingii, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces fertile fronds with sori that are clustered in short lines along the margins of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
