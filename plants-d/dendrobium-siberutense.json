    "intro": "Dendrobium siberutense, commonly known as the Siberut orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Indonesian island of Siberut. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the dry season. Its stems are terete and often form dense, branching structures. Dendrobium siberutense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
