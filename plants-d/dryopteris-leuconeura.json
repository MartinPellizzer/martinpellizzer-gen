    "intro": "Dryopteris leuconeura, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that feature a striking silver underside, which contrasts with its dark green upper surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
