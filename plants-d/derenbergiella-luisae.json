    "intro": "Derenbergiella luisae, commonly known as the Luisa's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring during the cooler months, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Derenbergiella luisae is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
