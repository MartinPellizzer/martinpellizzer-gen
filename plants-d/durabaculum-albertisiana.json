    "intro": "Durabaculum albertisiana, commonly known as the Albert's durabaculum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants adapted to humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
