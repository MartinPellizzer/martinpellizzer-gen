    "intro": "Desmodium occidentale, commonly known as western burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a hairy, inflated pod that contains several small, round seeds. Desmodium occidentale is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
