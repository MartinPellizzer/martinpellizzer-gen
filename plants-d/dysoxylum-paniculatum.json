    "intro": "Dysoxylum paniculatum, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain sticky, fleshy seeds. It thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key species in coastal vegetation and shoreline stabilization."
