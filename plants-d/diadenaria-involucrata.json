    "intro": "Diadenaria involucrata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, daisy-like cluster. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Diadenaria involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
