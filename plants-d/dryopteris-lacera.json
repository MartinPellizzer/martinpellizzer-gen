    "intro": "Dryopteris lacera, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often finely divided and covered in small, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
