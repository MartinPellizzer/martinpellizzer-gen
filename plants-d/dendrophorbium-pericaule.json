    "intro": "Dendrophorbium pericaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
