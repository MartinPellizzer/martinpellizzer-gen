    "intro": "Drimys xerophila, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile. It features aromatic, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Drimys xerophila is adapted to moist, cool environments and is often found in understory habitats of humid forests. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native region."
