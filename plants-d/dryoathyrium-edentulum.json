    "intro": "Dryoathyrium edentulum, commonly known as the toothless fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and its distinctive fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that lacks teeth, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of Asia. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
