    "intro": "Dioscorea helmiicarpa, commonly known as the spiral yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its helical twisting stems and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some African communities. The botanical features of D. helmiicarpa make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
