It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after specimen for collectors and botanists alike."
