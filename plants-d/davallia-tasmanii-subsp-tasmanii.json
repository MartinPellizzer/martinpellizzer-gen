It is a medium-sized evergreen fern with feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
