    "intro": "Dryas punctata var. henricae, commonly known as the Henricae's mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Dryas punctata."
