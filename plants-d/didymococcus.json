    "intro": "Didymococcus, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus\" in some cultures, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Didymococcus species are known for their broad, heart-shaped leaves and their ability to produce buoyant seeds that float on water. These botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
