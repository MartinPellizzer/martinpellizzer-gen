    "intro": "Doryopteris varians var. angularis, commonly known as the angular fern, is a variant of the variable shield fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a unique, serrated appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
