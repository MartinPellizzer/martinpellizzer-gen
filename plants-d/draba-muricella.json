    "intro": "Draba muricella, commonly known as the rough mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and have a distinctive rough texture. Draba muricella is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges."
