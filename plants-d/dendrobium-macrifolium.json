    "intro": "Dendrobium macrifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium macrifolium produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming during the dry season."
