    "intro": "Ditaxis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf senna, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, curved pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
