    "intro": "Dioscorea pendula, commonly known as the hanging yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, tuberous roots, which are its primary economic product. These roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. Dioscorea pendula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
