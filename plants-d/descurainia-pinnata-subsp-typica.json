    "intro": "Descurainia pinnata subsp. typica, commonly known as wild radish, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It features a robust taproot and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, peppery odor. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed habitats."
