    "intro": "Dioscorea monadelphoides, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for food and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been used as a staple food in various African communities. The plant also contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is less widely cultivated than other yam species."
