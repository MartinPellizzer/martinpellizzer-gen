It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Diplazium donnell-smithii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
