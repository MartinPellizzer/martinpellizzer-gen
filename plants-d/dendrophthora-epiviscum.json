    "intro": "Dendrophthora epiviscum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
