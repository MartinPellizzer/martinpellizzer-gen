    "intro": "Dorycnium suffruticosum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its fibrous root system makes it a useful plant for soil stabilization and erosion control."
