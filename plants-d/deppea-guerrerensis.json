    "intro": "Deppea guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrero deppea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
