    "intro": "Dryopteris woynarii, commonly known as the Woyna fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris woynarii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
