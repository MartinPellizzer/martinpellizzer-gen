    "intro": "Dracontia tuerckheimii f. viridiflavens, commonly known as the green-yellow form of the alpine bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range from greenish-yellow to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
