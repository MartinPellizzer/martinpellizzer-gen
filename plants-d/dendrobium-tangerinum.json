    "intro": "Dendrobium tangerinum, commonly known as the orange orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces showy, orange-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted for efficient water absorption. Dendrobium tangerinum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
