    "intro": "Delphinium consolida var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescences that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"pubescent\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
