    "intro": "Dorycnium dumulosum, commonly known as the rough vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Dorycnium dumulosum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
