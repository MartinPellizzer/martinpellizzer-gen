    "intro": "Darlingtonia brachyloba var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a reddish or purple hue, and they emit a sweet scent to attract prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating and downward-pointing hairs that prevent trapped insects from escaping. This variety is notable for its glandular structures that secrete digestive enzymes, aiding in the breakdown of captured prey."
