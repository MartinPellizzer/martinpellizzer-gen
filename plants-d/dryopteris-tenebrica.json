    "intro": "Dryopteris tenebrica, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant features fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
