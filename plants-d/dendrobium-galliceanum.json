It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). It produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive red or orange lip.
