    "intro": "Dicksonia lanata subsp. lanata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old leaf bases, which gives it a rugged appearance. The fronds are pinnately compound, with long, narrow segments that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
