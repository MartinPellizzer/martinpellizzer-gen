    "intro": "Dracophyllum muscoides, commonly known as the moss-like dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and other ericaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that resemble moss. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Dracophyllum muscoides is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
