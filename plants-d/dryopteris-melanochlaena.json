    "intro": "Dryopteris melanochlaena, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and large, triangular-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
