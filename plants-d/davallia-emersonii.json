    "intro": "Davallia emersonii, commonly known as the emerald fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. The plant features rhizomatous growth, with short, upright fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Davallia emersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
