    "intro": "Dryopteris waiwaiensis, commonly known as the Waiwai Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
