    "intro": "Diplazium mildei, commonly known as the Milde's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Diplazium mildei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
