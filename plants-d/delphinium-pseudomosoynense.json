    "intro": "Delphinium pseudomosoynense, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
