    "intro": "Dendrobium pohnpeiense, commonly known as the Pohnpei orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Pohnpei in Micronesia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern. This species is of significant ecological and cultural importance to the local communities of Pohnpei."
