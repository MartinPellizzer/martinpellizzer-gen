The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium obchantiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
