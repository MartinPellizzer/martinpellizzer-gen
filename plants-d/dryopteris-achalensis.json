    "intro": "Dryopteris achalensis, commonly known as the Achalensis shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to establish dense colonies over time. The fronds are typically deciduous, with the fertile fronds appearing in late summer and early autumn."
