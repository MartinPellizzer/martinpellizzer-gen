It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine or arctic habitats. It typically grows in rocky soils and is found in mountainous regions of North America. This subspecies is notable for its frost-resistant properties and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
