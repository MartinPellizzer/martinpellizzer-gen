It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a thick, fibrous rhizome that supports its large, compound fronds. Its leaves are typically divided into segments with serrated or toothed margins, giving it its common name. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
