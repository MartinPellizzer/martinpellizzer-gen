    "intro": "Dryopteris tenericaulis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil."
