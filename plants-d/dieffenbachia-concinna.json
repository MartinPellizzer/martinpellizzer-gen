    "intro": "Dieffenbachia concinna, commonly known as the Indian shot or arrowroot plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with white and green variegation, often adorned with prominent veins. The plant is characterized by its swollen, tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
