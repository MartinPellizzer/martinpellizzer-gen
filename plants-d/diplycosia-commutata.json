    "intro": "Diplycosia commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
