    "intro": "Dissotis pauwelsii, commonly known as the Pauwels' spider-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, curling petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has a short flowering period. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
