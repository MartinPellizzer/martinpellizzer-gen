    "intro": "Diacalpe aspidioides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
