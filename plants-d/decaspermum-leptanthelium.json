    "intro": "Decaspermum leptanthelium, commonly known as the slender-leaved decaspermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
