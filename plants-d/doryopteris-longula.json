    "intro": "Doryopteris longula, commonly known as the long-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with long, prominent veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the substrate. Doryopteris longula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
