    "intro": "Dudleya agourensis, commonly known as the Agoura Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
