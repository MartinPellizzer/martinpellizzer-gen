    "intro": "Deparia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's translucent, membranous texture gives it its common name and contributes to its unique appearance in aquatic ecosystems."
