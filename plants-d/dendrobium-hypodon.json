    "intro": "Dendrobium hypodon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, with a fragrant scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium hypodon is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
