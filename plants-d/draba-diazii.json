    "intro": "Draba diazii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba diazii is adapted to cold, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
