    "intro": "Dendrolirium laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous tree lily, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dendrolirium laxiflorum is considered an endangered species."
