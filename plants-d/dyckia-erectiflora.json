    "intro": "Dyckia erectiflora, commonly known as the upright-flowered dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a sought-after ornamental plant."
