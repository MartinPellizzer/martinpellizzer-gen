    "intro": "Dryopteris cycadina var. melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive dark green, leathery fronds. It features a tall, slender rhizome that supports a crown of bipinnate leaves with a compact, clustered appearance. The fronds are typically arching and have a unique, almost palm-like structure with closely spaced pinnae. This variety is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and conservation efforts."
