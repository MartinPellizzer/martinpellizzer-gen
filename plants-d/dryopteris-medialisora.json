    "intro": "Dryopteris medialisora, commonly known as the Middle Ridge wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
