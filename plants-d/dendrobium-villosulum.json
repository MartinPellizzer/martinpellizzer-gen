    "intro": "Dendrobium villosulum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin stems covered in soft, hairy tissue. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a contrasting lip, and they bloom during the rainy season. Dendrobium villosulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
