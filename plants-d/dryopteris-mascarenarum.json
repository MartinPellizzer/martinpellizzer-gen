    "intro": "Dryopteris mascarenarum, commonly known as the Mascarene wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental value."
