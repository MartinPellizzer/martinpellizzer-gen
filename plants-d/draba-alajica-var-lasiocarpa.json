    "intro": "Draba alajica var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a low-growing flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a compact rosette of basal leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, appearing in early spring. This variant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its adaptation to harsh mountainous climates."
