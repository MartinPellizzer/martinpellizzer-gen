    "intro": "Dryopteris radicans, commonly known as the royal fern, is a terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often described as \"fiddleheads\" when young, unfurling into a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
