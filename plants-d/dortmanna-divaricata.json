    "intro": "Dortmanna divaricata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Dortmanna divaricata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
