    "intro": "Desmostachys planchonianus f. nervosus, commonly known as the nervy planchonian lichen, is a specialized lichen with a unique botanical structure. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically flattened and leaf-like in appearance. The species exhibits a distinct network of cortical hyphae, contributing to its robust growth on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including apothecia, are embedded within the thallus, a feature common in many lichens. This lichen is often found in temperate regions, thriving in moist and shaded environments."
