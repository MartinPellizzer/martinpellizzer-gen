    "intro": "Davallia patens, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Davallia patens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ease of care."
