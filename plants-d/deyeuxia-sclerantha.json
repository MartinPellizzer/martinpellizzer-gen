    "intro": "Deyeuxia sclerantha, commonly known as the rigid false rice, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Deyeuxia sclerantha plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
