    "intro": "Diploknema oligomera, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
