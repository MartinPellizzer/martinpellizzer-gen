The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
