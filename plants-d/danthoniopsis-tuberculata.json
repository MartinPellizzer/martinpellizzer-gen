    "intro": "Danthoniopsis tuberculata, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Danthoniopsis tuberculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
