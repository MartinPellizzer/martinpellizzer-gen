    "intro": "Deparia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's intricate leaf structure and adaptability to humid conditions make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
