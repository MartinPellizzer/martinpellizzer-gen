    "intro": "Daucus junceus, commonly known as the common fool's parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers in umbels. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Daucus junceus is sometimes confused with toxic plants like hemlock, so careful identification is important."
