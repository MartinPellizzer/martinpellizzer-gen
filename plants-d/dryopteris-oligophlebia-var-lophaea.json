    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophlebia var. lophaea, commonly known as the narrow-veined wood fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
