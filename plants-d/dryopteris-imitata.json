    "intro": "Dryopteris imitata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that resemble holly leaves, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
