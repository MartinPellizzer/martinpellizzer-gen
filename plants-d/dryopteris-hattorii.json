    "intro": "Dryopteris hattorii, commonly known as the Hattori's wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
