    "intro": "Dalea purpurea var. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf prairieclover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with numerous small, linear leaflets, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
