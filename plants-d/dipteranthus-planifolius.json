    "intro": "Dipteranthus planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf dipteranthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branched stems that bear small, opposite leaves with a broad, ovate shape and a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the rich, moist soils of its natural habitat. Dipteranthus planifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in shaded, humid environments."
