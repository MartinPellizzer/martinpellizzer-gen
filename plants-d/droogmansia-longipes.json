    "intro": "Droogmansia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed droogmansia, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with the inflorescence emerging from the center. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with showy red bracts that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
