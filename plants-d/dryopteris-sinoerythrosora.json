    "intro": "Dryopteris sinoerythrosora, commonly known as the Chinese red-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with deep red veins contrasting against dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in natural habitats."
