    "intro": "Dorstenia lavrani, commonly known as the \"Lavran's false banana,\" is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem with waxy, strap-like leaves that are often adorned with distinctive patterns. Its flowers are borne in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, a common trait among arum family plants. Dorstenia lavrani is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, making it somewhat drought-tolerant."
