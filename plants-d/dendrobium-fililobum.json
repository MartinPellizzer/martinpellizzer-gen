    "intro": "Dendrobium fililobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid tropical environments. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Dendrobium fililobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
