    "intro": "Dioscorea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yams but are less commonly cultivated for food. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
