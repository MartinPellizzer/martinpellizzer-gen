    "intro": "Dendrobium acianthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive red or purple lip. Dendrobium acianthum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
