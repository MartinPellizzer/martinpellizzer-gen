    "intro": "Diplazium fauriei var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually evergreen and have a leathery texture. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The varietal form tenuifolium is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated foliage compared to the typical species."
