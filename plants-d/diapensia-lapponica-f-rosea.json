It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and delicate, pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats. Its floral structure consists of five petals and five sepals, typical of the Ericaceae family. Diapensia lapponica f. rosea plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides nectar for pollinators."
