    "intro": "Dryopteris yungtzeensis, commonly known as the Yungtze shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
