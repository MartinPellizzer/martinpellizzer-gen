    "intro": "Digitaria setigera var. setigera, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when young. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
