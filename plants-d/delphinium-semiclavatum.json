    "intro": "Delphinium semiclavatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other delphinium species, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
