It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or hemispherical shape, resembling a pincushion. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a notable species within the genus Dolomiaea."
