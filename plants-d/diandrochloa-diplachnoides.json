    "intro": "Diandrochloa diplachnoides, commonly known as the two-awned bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two awns on each lemma, a distinctive feature of the genus Diandrochloa. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
