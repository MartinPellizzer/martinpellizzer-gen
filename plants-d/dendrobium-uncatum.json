    "intro": "Dendrobium uncatum, commonly known as the naked orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem covered with a dense layer of roots, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Dendrobium uncatum is known for its long flowering period, often blooming multiple times a year. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
