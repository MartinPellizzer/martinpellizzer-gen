    "intro": "Dendropemon dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form tree fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive bifurcated fronds. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery fronds that split into two distinct forms at maturity. Its growth habit resembles that of a tree fern, with a rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots. Dendropemon dimorphus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
