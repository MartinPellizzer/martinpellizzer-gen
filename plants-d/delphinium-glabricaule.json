    "intro": "Delphinium glabricaule, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with smooth, glabrous bark. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and are arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, though the stems are hairless. Delphinium glabricaule is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
