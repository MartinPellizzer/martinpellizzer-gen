    "intro": "Dichaea pendula var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy pendant moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous growth habit and the presence of cilia on the leaf margins, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a slightly curled appearance, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its unique morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
