It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
