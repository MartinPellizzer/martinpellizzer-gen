    "intro": "Donaldia ottonis, commonly known as the Otton's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
