    "intro": "Dicksonia decomposita, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts and are also valued for their ornamental qualities in horticulture."
