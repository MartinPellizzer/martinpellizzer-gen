    "intro": "Dendrobium falcorostrum, commonly known as the falcon-beak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium falcorostrum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
