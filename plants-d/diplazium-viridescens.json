    "intro": "Diplazium viridescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
