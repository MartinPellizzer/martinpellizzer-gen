    "intro": "Digitalis dubia var. palaui, commonly known as the Palaui foxglove, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces distinctive, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
