    "intro": "Dupatya vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its viviparous reproduction method, where the sporophytes develop on the mother plant before being released. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually pinnately compound. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, producing spores for dispersal. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical forests."
