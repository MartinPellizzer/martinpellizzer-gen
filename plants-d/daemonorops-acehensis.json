    "intro": "Daemonorops acehensis, commonly known as the Aceh pandan, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in local cuisines. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in fibrous, woody pods and are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops acehensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
