    "intro": "Dendrochilum tetradactyliferum, commonly known as the four-fingered tree orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky substrates. The orchid's name refers to the four fingers-like structures on its floral bracts, which are distinctive in appearance."
