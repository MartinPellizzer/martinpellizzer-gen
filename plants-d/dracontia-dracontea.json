    "intro": "Dracontia dracontea, commonly known as the dragon's tail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
