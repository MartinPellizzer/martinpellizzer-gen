    "intro": "Didissandra lineata, commonly known as the Australian water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Australia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
