    "intro": "Dendrobium woluense, commonly known as the Woluense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces upright, lance-shaped leaves and bears pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil. Dendrobium woluense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
