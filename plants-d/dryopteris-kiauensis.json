    "intro": "Dryopteris kiauensis, commonly known as the Kiau fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly found in countries like China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
