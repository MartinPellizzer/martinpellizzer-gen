    "intro": "Dryopteris robusta, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated edge. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. Dryopteris robusta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
