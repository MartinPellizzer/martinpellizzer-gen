    "intro": "Dendrobium elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can reach several feet in length, often with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium elongatum thrives in humid, warm climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
