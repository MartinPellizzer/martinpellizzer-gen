    "intro": "Dimeria glabra, commonly known as the smooth dimeria, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are often reduced to scales or spines. Dimeria glabra is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and exhibiting a CAM photosynthetic pathway to conserve moisture."
