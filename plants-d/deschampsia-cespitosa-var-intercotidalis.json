    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. intercotidalis, commonly known as the coastal tufted grass, is a variant of the tufted grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. This plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety is notable for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
