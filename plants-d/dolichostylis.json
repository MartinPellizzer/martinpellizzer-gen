    "intro": "Dolichostylis, commonly known as the long-styled orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, featuring elongated stamens that often extend beyond the petals. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Dolichostylis species are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil. Their flowers are usually small and delicate, with a striking contrast between the vibrant colors of the petals and the pale, elongated stamens."
