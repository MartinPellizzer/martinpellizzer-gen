    "intro": "Danthonia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, blade-like leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet to mesic habitats, such as marshes, swales, and forest floors, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
