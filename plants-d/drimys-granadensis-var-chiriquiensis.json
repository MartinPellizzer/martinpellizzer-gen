    "intro": "Drimys granadensis var. chiriquiensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed drimys, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid tropical forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Winteraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
