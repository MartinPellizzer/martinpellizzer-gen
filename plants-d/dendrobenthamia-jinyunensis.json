It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
