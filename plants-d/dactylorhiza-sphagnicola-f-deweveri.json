    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. deweveri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to peat bogs in northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often obscured by the dense vegetation of its habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
