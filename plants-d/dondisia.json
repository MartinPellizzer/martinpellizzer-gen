    "intro": "Dondisia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Dondisia species typically grow as compact shrubs or herbs, with leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, such as Dondisia glabra and Dondisia hirta, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
