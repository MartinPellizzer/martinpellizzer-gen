    "intro": "Delissea fallax, commonly known as the dwarf wax plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in a waxy, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
