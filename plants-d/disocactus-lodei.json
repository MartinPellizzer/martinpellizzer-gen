    "intro": "Disocactus lodei, commonly known as the Lode's candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in arid climates."
