    "intro": "Dubautia \u00d7 mendax, commonly known as the hybrid snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dubautia hawaiiensis and Dubautia sargentii. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
