    "intro": "Diphryllum australe, commonly known as the Australian beak fern, is a unique evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted fronds that resemble a beak, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern. Diphryllum australe thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understoreys."
