    "intro": "Dracula marsupialis, commonly known as the \"Marsupial Dragon\" or \"Red Dragon,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange petals, which resemble the scales of a dragon, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers are highly specialized, with long, slender petals that curl backward, aiding in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Dracula marsupialis is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
