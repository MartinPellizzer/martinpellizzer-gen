    "intro": "Dendrobium platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, flat lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium platyphyllum thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
