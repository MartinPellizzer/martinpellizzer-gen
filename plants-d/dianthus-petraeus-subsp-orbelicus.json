    "intro": "Dianthus petraeus subsp. orbelicus, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh conditions of its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
