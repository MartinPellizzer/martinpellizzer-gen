    "intro": "Desmanthus jamesii var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's burrlegume, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny seed pods that remain attached to the plant throughout the winter. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
