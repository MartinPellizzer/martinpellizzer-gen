    "intro": "Dryopteris tenerifrons, commonly known as the Canary Island wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
