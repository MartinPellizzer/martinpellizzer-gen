    "intro": "Draconia salsoloides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Draconia salsoloides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
