    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris goldiana. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden or bronze tinge on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically found in the axils of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
