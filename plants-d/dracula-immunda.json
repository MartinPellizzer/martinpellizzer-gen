    "intro": "Dracula immunda, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its ominous common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
