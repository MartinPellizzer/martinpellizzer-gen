    "intro": "Dendrobium unibulbe, commonly known as the single-bulb orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, characterized by a single, swollen pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Dendrobium unibulbe is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
