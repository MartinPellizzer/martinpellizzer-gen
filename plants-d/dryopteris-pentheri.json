    "intro": "Dryopteris pentheri, commonly known as the Penther's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often zigzagging appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Dryopteris pentheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
