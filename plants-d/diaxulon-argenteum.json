    "intro": "Diaxulon argenteum, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and star-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that reflects sunlight, aiding in water conservation. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Diaxulon argenteum is considered a vulnerable species."
