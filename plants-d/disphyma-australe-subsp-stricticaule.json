    "intro": "Disphyma australe subsp. stricticaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically during spring. It is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of coastal and inland shrublands."
