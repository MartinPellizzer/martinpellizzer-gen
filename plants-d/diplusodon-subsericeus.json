It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Diplusodon subsericeus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
