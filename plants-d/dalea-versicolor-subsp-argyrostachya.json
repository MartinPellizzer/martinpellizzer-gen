    "intro": "Dalea versicolor subsp. argyrostachya, commonly known as the silver-stem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, silver-hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compound leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules."
