    "intro": "Dendrobium nodatum, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Dendrobium nodatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
