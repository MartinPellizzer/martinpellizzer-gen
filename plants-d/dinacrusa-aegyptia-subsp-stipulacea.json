    "intro": "Dinacrusa aegyptia subsp. stipulacea, commonly known as the Egyptian thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, spiny leaves, and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
