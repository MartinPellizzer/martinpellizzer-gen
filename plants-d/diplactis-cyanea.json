    "intro": "Diplactis cyanea, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its striking blue-violet inflorescences. Its leaves are typically pale green with a leathery texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments.
