    "intro": "Delosperma purpureum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
