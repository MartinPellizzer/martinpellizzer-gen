    "intro": "Dalea querceti, commonly known as the oakleaf dalea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, and it produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. Dalea querceti is often found in association with oak trees, hence its common name."
