    "intro": "Drymocallis malacophylla, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. Drymocallis malacophylla is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats across its native range."
