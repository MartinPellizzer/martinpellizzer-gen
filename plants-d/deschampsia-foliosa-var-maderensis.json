    "intro": "Deschampsia foliosa var. maderensis, commonly known as Mader's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
