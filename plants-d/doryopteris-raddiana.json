    "intro": "Doryopteris raddiana, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Doryopteris raddiana thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
