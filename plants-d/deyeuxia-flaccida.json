    "intro": "Deyeuxia flaccida, commonly known as the soft grass or slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Deyeuxia flaccida is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its use in restoration projects."
