    "intro": "Dennstaedtia punctilobula var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that often exhibit a unique, curled or crisped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, spongy layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
