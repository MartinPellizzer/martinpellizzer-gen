    "intro": "Dendrobium teretifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
