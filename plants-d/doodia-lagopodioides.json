It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the fur of a hare. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing leaves. Doodia lagopodioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
