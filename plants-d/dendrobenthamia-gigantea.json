    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
