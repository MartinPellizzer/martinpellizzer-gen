    "intro": "Dalbergia retusa var. lineata, commonly known as the lined rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
