    "intro": "Dyckia coccinea, commonly known as the red dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround the inflorescence, which is often more prominent than the actual flowers. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia coccinea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
