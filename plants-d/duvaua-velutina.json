    "intro": "Duvaua velutina, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to two meters. Its foliage is often dark green with a dense, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Duvaua velutina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
