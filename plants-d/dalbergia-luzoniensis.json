    "intro": "Dalbergia luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon ebony, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its economic value, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
