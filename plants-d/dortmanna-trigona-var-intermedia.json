    "intro": "Dortmanna trigona var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny, pale green tubercles that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-resistant landscaping."
