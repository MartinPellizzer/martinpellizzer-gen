    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 burgessii, commonly known as the Burgess shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris pentaphylla. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
