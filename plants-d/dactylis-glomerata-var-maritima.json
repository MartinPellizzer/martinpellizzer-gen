    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it tolerate saline and wind-blown conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Sea bentgrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
