It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are borne in clusters, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
