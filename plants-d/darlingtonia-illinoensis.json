    "intro": "Darlingtonia illinoensis, commonly known as the Illinois pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Illinois. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with red or purple veins, and they produce a strong, sweet-smelling odor to attract prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires consistent humidity and nutrient-poor soil. Darlingtonia illinoensis plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
