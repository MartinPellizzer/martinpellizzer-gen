    "intro": "Dendrobium miserum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a prized and protected species in conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
