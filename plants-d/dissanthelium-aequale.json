    "intro": "Dissanthelium aequale, commonly known as the common sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
