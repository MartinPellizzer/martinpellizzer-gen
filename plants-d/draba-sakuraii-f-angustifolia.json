    "intro": "Draba sakuraii f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Draba, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in alpine or rocky habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. It has a compact growth form, which helps it survive in harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of Asia."
