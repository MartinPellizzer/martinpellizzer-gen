    "intro": "Dicranolepis disticha var. thomensis, commonly known as the Tom\u00e9nsis hairpin fern, is a variant of the hairpin fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, recurved fronds that form a hairpin shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the rachis. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
