It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its long, slender peduncles that bear the inflorescences, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
