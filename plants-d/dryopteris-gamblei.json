    "intro": "Dryopteris gamblei, commonly known as the Gambier fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
