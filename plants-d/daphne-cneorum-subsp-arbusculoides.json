It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and a compact, spreading growth habit. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
