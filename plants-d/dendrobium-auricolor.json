    "intro": "Dendrobium auricolor, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with upright, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers with a velvety texture, often arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium auricolor is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and relatively easy care requirements."
