    "intro": "Dryopteris sinonepalensis, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
