    "intro": "Deinandra greeneana subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Deinandra, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly found in Texas and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
