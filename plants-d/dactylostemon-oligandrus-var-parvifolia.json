    "intro": "Dactylostemon oligandrus var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rock fig, is a rare and woody shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
