    "intro": "Dubyaea gombalana, commonly known as the Gombalana plant, is a flowering shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related species. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Dubyaea gombalana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
