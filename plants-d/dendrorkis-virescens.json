    "intro": "Dendrorkis virescens, commonly known as the green tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central rhizome that supports the trunk and produces new fronds from the base. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Dendrorkis virescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
