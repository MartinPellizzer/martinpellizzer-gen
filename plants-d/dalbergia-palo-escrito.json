It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by legumes containing seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
