    "intro": "Dryopteris besukiensis, commonly known as the Besuki shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
