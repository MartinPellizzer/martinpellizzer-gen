    "intro": "Dendrobium stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Dendrobium stenopterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
