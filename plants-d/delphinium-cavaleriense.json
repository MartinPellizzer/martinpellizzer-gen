    "intro": "Delphinium cavaleriense, commonly known as the Cavaleri's larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are characterized by their spurred petals, a distinctive feature of the Delphinium genus. The plant has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
