    "intro": "Digitaria alba, commonly known as white panicgrass, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, white or pale green spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it blooms during the summer months. Digitaria alba is an important forage plant for livestock in some regions and can also be invasive in certain ecosystems."
