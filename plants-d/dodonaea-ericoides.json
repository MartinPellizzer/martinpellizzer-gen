    "intro": "Dodonaea ericoides, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to Australia. It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its woody stems are often covered in a sticky resin, which can make it challenging to handle. Dodonaea ericoides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
