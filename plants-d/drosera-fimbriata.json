    "intro": "Drosera fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it reproduces through seeds or by vegetative propagation. Drosera fimbriata is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cool, moist conditions."
