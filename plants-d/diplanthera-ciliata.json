    "intro": "Diplanthera ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with finely ciliate margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Diplanthera ciliata is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a low, spreading form to reduce water loss."
