    "intro": "Dendrophthoe clementis, commonly known as the Clement's ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the branches of trees or shrubs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruit, which is fleshy and edible. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
