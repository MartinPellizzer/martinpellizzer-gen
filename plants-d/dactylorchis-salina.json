    "intro": "Dactylorchis salina, commonly known as the salt marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, adapting to high salt concentrations in its environment. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is an epiphytic orchid, often growing on the stems of other plants in its habitat. Dactylorchis salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
