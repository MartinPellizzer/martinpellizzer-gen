    "intro": "Dampiera repens, commonly known as the creeping dampiera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy areas. Dampiera repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
