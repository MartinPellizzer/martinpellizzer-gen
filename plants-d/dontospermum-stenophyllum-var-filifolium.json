    "intro": "Dontospermum stenophyllum var. filifolium, commonly known as the thread-leaved rock fig, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that are narrow and thread-like in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically consumed by various bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
