It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various organisms. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the muddy substrate of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming at night and attracting specific pollinators. The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
