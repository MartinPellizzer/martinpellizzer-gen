It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Dizygostemon floribundus thrives in warm climates and requires high humidity and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
