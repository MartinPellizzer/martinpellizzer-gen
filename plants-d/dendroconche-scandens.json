It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit and often forms dense mats along rocky shores. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture in arid environments. Dendroconche scandens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
