    "intro": "Dolichothele, commonly known as the long-tailed spider, is a genus of arachnids belonging to the family Caponiidae. These spiders are characterized by their elongated, slender bodies and long, whip-like legs, which aid in their agile movement. They are primarily found in Australia and are known for their unique web structures, which are often built in sheltered locations such as under bark or in crevices. Dolichothele spiders are typically nocturnal and feed on other small arthropods. Their ecological role includes contributing to the control of insect populations in their habitats."
