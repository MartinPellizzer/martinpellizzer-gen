    "intro": "Dicksonia pilosiuscula f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a compact variant of the tree fern family. It features a short, stout trunk with a dense, hairy crown of fronds that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive fern-like appearance, and the plant exhibits a slow growth rate. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden settings. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural displays."
