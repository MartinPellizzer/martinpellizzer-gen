    "intro": "Drosera brevicornis, commonly known as the dwarf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Drosera brevicornis is a low-growing species, often reaching only a few centimeters in height."
