    "intro": "Ditassa colellae, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and often grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
