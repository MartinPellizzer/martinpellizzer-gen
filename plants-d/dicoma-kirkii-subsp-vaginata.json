It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the winter months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
