    "intro": "Diplazium grandifolium var. brevifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with fertile spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the underside of the pinnae. This variant thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
