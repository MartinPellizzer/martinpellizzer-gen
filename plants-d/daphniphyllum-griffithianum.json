    "intro": "Daphniphyllum griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's laurel, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
