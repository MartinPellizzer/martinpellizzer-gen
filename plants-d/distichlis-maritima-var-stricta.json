    "intro": "Distichlis maritima var. stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions, making it a valuable plant for coastal stabilization. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion and supports biodiversity in salt marsh ecosystems."
