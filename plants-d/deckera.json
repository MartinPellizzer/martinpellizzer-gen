    "intro": "Deckera, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, often arranged in whorls around the stems. Deckera species produce small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
