    "intro": "Dysoxylum beccarianum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its dark, bark-like trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in mangrove forests."
