    "intro": "Digitalis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky foxglove, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear hooded flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant produces a sticky, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and medicinally significant. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Digitalis glutinosa is often found in woodland edges and meadows, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
