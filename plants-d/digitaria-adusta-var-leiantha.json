It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late summer to early fall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
