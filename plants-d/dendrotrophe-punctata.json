    "intro": "Dendrotrophe punctata, commonly known as the spotted bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on the bark of trees in temperate regions. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green thallus with scattered black dots, which are the reproductive structures called soredia. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on the trunks and branches of hardwood trees, particularly oaks and maples. Dendrotrophe punctata is an indicator species for clean air and healthy forest ecosystems."
