    "intro": "Digitaria variabilis, commonly known as variable digitgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Digitaria variabilis is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
