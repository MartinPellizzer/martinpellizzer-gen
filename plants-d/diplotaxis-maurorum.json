    "intro": "Diplotaxis maurorum, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs and produces yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-like fruits. The plant's foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. Its fruits, which are edible when ripe, are encased in a papery calyx that turns red or orange. Diplotaxis maurorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for cultivation."
