    "intro": "Dillenia scandens, commonly known as the climbing dillenia, is a tropical shrub or vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by large, edible fruits that resemble a cross between a pineapple and a fig. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes in tropical gardens. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
