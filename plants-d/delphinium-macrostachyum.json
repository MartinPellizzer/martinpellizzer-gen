    "intro": "Delphinium macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with five showy petals and numerous stamens, forming a distinctive spurred shape. Delphinium macrostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal but is also toxic to humans and livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
