    "intro": "Dryopteris falcatipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate, finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
