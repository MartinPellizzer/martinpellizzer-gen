It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
