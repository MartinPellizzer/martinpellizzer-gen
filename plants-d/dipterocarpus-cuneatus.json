    "intro": "Dipterocarpus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dipterocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of tropical rainforests, providing habitat and food for various species. Dipterocarpus cuneatus is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
