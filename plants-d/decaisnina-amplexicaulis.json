    "intro": "Decaisnina amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, overlapping leaves that tightly encircle the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
