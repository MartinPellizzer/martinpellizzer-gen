    "intro": "Dryopteris sericea, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging in the spring and unfurling throughout the growing season. Dryopteris sericea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
