    "intro": "Delaria, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Delaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
