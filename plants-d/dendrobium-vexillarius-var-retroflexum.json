    "intro": "Dendrobium vexillarius var. retroflexum, commonly known as the Purple-veined Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like tissue. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive purple or violet hue and a white or pale yellow throat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
