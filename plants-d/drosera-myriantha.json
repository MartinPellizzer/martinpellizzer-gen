    "intro": "Drosera myriantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky-hair covered leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with red or pink hues, and they secrete a viscous liquid to immobilize prey. Drosera myriantha thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It is a perennial species that produces small, white flowers during the summer months."
