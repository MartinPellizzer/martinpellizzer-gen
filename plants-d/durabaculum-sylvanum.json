    "intro": "Durabaculum sylvanum, commonly known as the forest endurance plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate forests of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by round, fleshy berries that mature to a deep red color. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Durabaculum sylvanum is adapted to partial shade and is often found in woodland understories where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for local wildlife."
