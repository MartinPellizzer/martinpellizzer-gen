    "intro": "Dinetopsis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered dinetopsis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to animals. Dinetopsis grandiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
