    "intro": "Disemma medusaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant species native to certain parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Disemma medusaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
