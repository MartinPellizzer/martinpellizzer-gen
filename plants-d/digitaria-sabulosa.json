    "intro": "Digitaria sabulosa, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. It produces seed heads that are loosely arranged in a panicle, with small, pale brown grains. Digitaria sabulosa is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
