    "intro": "Dendrobium graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that resemble grass, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Dendrobium graminifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
