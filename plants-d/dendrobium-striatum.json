    "intro": "Dendrobium striatum, commonly known as the stripe-lipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink with distinctive dark stripes, adding to its ornamental value. Dendrobium striatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
