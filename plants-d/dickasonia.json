    "intro": "Dickasonia, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dicksoniaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Dickasonia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often forming dense mats. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
