It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, often dark green pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium reypimentelii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining potting media."
