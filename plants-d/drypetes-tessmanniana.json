    "intro": "Drypetes tessmanniana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
