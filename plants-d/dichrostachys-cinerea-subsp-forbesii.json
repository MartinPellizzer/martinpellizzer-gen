    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' stranglewood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Forbes' stranglewood is noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local vegetation dynamics."
