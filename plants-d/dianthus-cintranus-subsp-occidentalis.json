It is characterized by its showy, clustered pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
