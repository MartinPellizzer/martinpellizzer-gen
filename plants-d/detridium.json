    "intro": "Detridium, commonly known as the common lichen, is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in a variety of environments, including tree bark, rocks, and soil, and is often found in moist, shaded areas. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption and photosynthesis. Detridium plays a crucial role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for environmental health."
