    "intro": "Dipterocarpus palosapis, commonly known as the Philippine dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall stature and buttressed roots, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain seeds, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. It plays a significant role in the ecological structure of lowland dipterocarp forests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
