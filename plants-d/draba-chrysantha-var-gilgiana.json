    "intro": "Draba chrysantha var. gilgiana, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
