    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry Shield Fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. This fern is native to the Appalachian region and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
