    "intro": "Dasiphora veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is relatively low maintenance once established."
