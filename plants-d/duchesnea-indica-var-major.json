    "intro": "Duchesnea indica var. major, commonly known as the common strawberry plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to true strawberries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its ability to spread through runners, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
