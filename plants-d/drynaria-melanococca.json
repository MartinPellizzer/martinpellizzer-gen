    "intro": "Drynaria melanococca, commonly known as the black-fruit fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, upright rhizome and its distinctive, leathery fronds that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
