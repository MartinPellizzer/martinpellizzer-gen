    "intro": "Diplostemma acaule, commonly known as the stemless bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves emerging directly from the base. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often basal, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. Diplostemma acaule thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
