    "intro": "Diplazium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnate and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Diplazium heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
