    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. caporientalis, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a subspecies native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, feathery leaves. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped umbel, and bloom in the summer months. Its roots are usually smaller and less fleshy compared to the common carrot, but they are edible and have a slightly bitter taste. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible roots."
