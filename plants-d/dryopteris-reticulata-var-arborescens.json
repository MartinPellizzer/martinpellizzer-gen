    "intro": "Dryopteris reticulata var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a central trunk-like structure covered in a layer of dead fronds, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like pattern that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
