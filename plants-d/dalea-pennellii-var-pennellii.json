    "intro": "Dalea pennellii var. pennellii, commonly known as the plains false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive silvery-blue appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers, which are usually purple or violet, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
