    "intro": "Diplopappus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is notable for its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and help in water retention. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces achenes with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local vegetation."
