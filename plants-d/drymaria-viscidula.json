    "intro": "Drymaria viscidula, commonly known as stickyweed or sticky sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, prostrate stems that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, further aiding in water retention. Drymaria viscidula thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments."
