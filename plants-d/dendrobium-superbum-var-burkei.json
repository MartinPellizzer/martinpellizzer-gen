    "intro": "Dendrobium superbum var. burkei, commonly known as the Burke's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of Tasmania. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
