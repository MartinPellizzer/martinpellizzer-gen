    "intro": "Davallia pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, which help it spread and thrive in its natural habitat. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
