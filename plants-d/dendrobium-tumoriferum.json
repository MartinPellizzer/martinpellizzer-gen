    "intro": "Dendrobium tumoriferum, commonly known as the tumor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its unique appearance, including the swollen, tumor-like structures on its stems, gives it its common name. Dendrobium tumoriferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
