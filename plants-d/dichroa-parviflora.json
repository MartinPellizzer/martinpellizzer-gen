    "intro": "Dichroa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered dichroa, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, two-toned leaves that change color depending on light conditions, displaying a dark green on one side and a lighter, often silvery-green on the other. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a specialty plant in horticulture."
