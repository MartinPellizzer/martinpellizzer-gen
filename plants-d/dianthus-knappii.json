It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often clustered in racemes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
