    "intro": "Dendrobium serratilabium, commonly known as the serrated lip dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with distinctive serrated lip petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium serratilabium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
