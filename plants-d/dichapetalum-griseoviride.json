It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with a subtle bluish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate contrast to its lush foliage. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
