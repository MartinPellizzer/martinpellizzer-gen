    "intro": "Dryopteris pica, commonly known as the variegated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
