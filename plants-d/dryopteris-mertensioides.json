    "intro": "Dryopteris mertensioides, commonly known as the Mertens' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
