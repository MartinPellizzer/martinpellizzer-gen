    "intro": "Drimia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant bulbous plant or African lily, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its large, fleshy, spherical bulbs that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces tall, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its bulbs are adapted for storage of water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
