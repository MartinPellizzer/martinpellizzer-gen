It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal and rosette-like. Draba boliviana is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
