It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
