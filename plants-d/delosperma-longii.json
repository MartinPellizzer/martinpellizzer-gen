    "intro": "Delosperma longii, commonly known as the narrowleaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Delosperma longii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
