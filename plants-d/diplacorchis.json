    "intro": "Diplacorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that bloom directly from the stems. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its botanical features include a rhizome system and specialized roots that absorb nutrients from the air. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Diplacorchis is considered a conservation concern."
