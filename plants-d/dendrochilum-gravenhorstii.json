It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth, and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Dendrochilum gravenhorstii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
