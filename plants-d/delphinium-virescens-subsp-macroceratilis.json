    "intro": "Delphinium virescens subsp. macroceratilis, commonly known as the giant blue larkspur, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces long, slender seed pods that split open at maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that are harmful to humans and animals."
