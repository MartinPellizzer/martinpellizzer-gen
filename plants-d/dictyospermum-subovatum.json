It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
