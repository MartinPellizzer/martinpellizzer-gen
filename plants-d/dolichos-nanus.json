    "intro": "Dolichos nanus, commonly known as dwarf cowpea, is a small leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to slender, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Dolichos nanus is often grown as a cover crop or for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
