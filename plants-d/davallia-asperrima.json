    "intro": "Davallia asperrima, commonly known as the serrated hakea, is a fern native to Australia. It features fronds that are deeply lobed and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia asperrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
