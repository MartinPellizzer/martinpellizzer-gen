    "intro": "Daphne orientalis, commonly known as the oriental daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features striking, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink and are borne on short, hairy pedicels. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in the garden."
