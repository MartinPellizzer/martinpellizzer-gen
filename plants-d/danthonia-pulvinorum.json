    "intro": "Danthonia pulvinorum, commonly known as the pulvinate danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and sandy habitats. Danthonia pulvinorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
