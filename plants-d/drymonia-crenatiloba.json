    "intro": "Drymonia crenatiloba, commonly known as the crenate drymonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
