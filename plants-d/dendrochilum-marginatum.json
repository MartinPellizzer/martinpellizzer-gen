    "intro": "Dendrochilum marginatum, commonly known as the margined tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fleshy stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers typically range in color from white to pale pink, with distinctive yellow or green markings. Dendrochilum marginatum thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests."
