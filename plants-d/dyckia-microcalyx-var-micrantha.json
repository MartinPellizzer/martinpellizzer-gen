    "intro": "Dyckia microcalyx var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf dyckia, is a compact, low-growing bromeliad native to Brazil. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, tufted appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental foliage. Dyckia microcalyx var. micrantha is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
