    "intro": "Dendrobium aristiferum, commonly known as the feather-armed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces upright, lance-shaped leaves and bears racemes of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, feather-like sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Dendrobium aristiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
