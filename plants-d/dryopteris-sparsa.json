    "intro": "Dryopteris sparsa, commonly known as the sparse wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from fertile fronds that develop in the spring. The botanical features of Dryopteris sparsa make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
