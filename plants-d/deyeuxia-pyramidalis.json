    "intro": "Deyeuxia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Deyeuxia pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
