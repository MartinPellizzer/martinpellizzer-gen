    "intro": "Dichostylis, commonly known as the two-styled grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct stigmas, which are often positioned at different levels within the flower. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist or wetland habitats. Dichostylis species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
