    "intro": "Dissotis denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with fine, toothed margins, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. It is often found in low-lying areas with standing water, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in wetland restoration."
