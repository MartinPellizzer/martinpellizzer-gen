    "intro": "Dryopteris flaccida, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
