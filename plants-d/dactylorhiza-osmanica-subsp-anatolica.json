    "intro": "Dactylorhiza osmanica subsp. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, calcareous soils. It has a complex root system with a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
