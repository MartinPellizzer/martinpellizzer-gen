    "intro": "Distylium elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf distylium, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, with two different flower types (dichogamy) that aid in cross-pollination. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Distylium elaeagnoides is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas."
