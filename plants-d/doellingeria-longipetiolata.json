It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves with long petioles that help it remain buoyant. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in the summer months. Doellingeria longipetiolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and small fish."
