    "intro": "Dacryodes sclerophylla, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high wood value, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
