    "intro": "Duroia aquatica, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along riverbanks. Duroia aquatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
