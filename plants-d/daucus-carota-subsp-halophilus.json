    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. halophilus, commonly known as the salt marsh carrot, is a subspecies of the carrot plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has a more compact growth form compared to the common carrot. Its leaves are typically shorter and more robust, and the roots are less developed than those of the cultivated carrot. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal soils and its potential for agricultural use in saline regions."
