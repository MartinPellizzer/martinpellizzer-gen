It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive two-toned appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
