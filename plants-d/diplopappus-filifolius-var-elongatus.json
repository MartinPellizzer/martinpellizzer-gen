    "intro": "Diplopappus filifolius var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-leaved burrweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. The varietal form, elongatus, is distinguished by its longer foliage compared to the typical variety."
