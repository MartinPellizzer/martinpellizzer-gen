    "intro": "Dittrichia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plants typically have small, narrow leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow or white. They are well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Dittrichia species are often used in landscaping for their hardiness and ornamental value."
