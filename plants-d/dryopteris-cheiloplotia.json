    "intro": "Dryopteris cheiloplotia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
