    "intro": "Dendrobium numaldeorii, commonly known as the Numaldeorii orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery). It produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the dry season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
