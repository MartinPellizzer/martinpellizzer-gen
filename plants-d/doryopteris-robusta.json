    "intro": "Doryopteris robusta, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost leathery texture and a bright green color. Doryopteris robusta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
