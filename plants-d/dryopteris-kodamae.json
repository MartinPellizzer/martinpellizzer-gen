    "intro": "Dryopteris kodamae, commonly known as the Kodama's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soil. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in shaded garden settings."
