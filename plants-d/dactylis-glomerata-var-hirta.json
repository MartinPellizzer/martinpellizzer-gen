    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. hirta, commonly known as hairy cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that distinguish it from other varieties of Dactylis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Hairy cocksfoot is valued for its forage quality and has been used historically in agriculture and land management."
