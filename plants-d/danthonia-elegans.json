It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscaping projects."
