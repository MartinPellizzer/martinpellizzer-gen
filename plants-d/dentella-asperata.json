    "intro": "Dentella asperata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper layers of the soil. Dentella asperata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
