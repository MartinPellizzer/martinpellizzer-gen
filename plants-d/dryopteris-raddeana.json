    "intro": "Dryopteris raddeana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments. It thrives in woodland areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
