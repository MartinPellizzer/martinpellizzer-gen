    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. deversa, commonly known as the broad male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with fertile pinnae that bear clusters of sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
