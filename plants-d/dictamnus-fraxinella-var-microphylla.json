    "intro": "Dictamnus fraxinella var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf fraxinella dictamnus, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant leaves and delicate floral display."
