    "intro": "Danthonia exilis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Danthonia exilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
