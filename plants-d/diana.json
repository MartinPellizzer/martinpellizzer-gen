    "intro": "Diana, commonly known as the moonflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers typically open in the evening and close by morning, adapting to the plant's nocturnal pollination strategy."
