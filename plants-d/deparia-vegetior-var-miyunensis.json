    "intro": "Deparia vegetior var. miyunensis, commonly known as the Miyun mountain fern, is a variant of the broader Deparia vegetior species. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. This variant is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity."
