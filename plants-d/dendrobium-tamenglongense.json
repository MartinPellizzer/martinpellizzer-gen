    "intro": "Dendrobium tamenglongense, commonly known as the Tamenglong orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, pseudobulbous stems and long, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
