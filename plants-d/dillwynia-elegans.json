It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Dillwynia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
