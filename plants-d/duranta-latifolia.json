    "intro": "Duranta latifolia, commonly known as the glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by orange or red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Duranta latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
