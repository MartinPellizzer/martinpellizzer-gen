    "intro": "Diplachne cearensis, commonly known as the Cear\u00e1 grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne cearensis is adapted to thrive in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of wetland ecosystems and plant adaptation."
