    "intro": "Dryopteris rigescens, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The fern's hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
