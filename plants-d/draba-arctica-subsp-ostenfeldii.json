    "intro": "Draba arctica subsp. ostenfeldii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils."
