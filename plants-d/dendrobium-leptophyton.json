    "intro": "Dendrobium leptophyton, commonly known as the slender-leaved dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like. It blooms with fragrant, showy flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
