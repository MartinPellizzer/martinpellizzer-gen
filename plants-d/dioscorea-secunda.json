    "intro": "Dioscorea secunda, commonly known as the secondary yam, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, while not as commercially important as other yam species, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Dioscorea secunda is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
