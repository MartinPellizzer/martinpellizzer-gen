    "intro": "Diandrochloa glomerata, commonly known as the clustered grass or slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. Diandrochloa glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
