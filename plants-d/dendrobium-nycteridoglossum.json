    "intro": "Dendrobium nycteridoglossum, commonly known as the night-lit lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant's flowers have a unique structure with a lip that emits a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium nycteridoglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking nocturnal blooms."
