    "intro": "Dracula sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble miniature skulls, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has dark, velvety petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that is often a deep red or maroon color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dracula sibundoyensis is considered a vulnerable species."
