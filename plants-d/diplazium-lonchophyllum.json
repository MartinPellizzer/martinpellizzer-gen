    "intro": "Diplazium lonchophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. Diplazium lonchophyllum is often found in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light and high humidity."
