    "intro": "Dahlia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf dahlia, is a tuberous-rooted perennial plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, single or double flowers in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its tubers are used as a food source in some regions, and the plant is also cultivated for ornamental purposes. Dahlia cordifolia is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
