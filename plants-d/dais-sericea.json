    "intro": "Dais sericea, commonly known as the silky daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, silky-haired leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Dais sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
