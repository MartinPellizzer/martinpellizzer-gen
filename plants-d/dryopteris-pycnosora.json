    "intro": "Dryopteris pycnosora, commonly known as the dense-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a stout, short rhizome with a thick, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that give the plant a lush, full appearance. Dryopteris pycnosora is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
