    "intro": "Deschampsia koelerioides, commonly known as Koeler's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with fine, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in wetland habitats."
