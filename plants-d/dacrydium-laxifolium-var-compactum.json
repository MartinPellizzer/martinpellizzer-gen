    "intro": "Dacrydium laxifolium var. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf rimu, is a compact, evergreen conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones that are usually woody and contain small, oval seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in native forests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
