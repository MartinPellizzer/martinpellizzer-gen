    "intro": "Drosera subhirtella subsp. moorei, commonly known as Moore's Sundew, is a species of sundew native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects for nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other Drosera species."
