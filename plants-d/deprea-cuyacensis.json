    "intro": "Deprea cuyacensis, commonly known as the Cuyacensis bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
