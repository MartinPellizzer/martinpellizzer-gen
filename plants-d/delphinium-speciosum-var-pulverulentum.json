The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its finely powdered bloom, giving it a unique, almost dusty appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
