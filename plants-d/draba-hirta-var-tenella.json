    "intro": "Draba hirta var. tenella, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration in degraded alpine habitats."
