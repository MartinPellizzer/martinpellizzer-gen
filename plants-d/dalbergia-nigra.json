    "intro": "Dalbergia nigra, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to overharvesting, Dalbergia nigra is now classified as endangered in many regions."
