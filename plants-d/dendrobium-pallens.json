    "intro": "Dendrobium pallens, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous horizontal pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium pallens thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
