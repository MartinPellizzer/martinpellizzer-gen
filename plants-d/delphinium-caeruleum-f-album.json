    "intro": "Delphinium caeruleum f. album, commonly known as the white larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of large, showy white flowers with prominent blue or purple veins. The plant's foliage consists of deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
