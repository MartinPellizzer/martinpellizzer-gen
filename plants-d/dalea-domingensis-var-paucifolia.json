    "intro": "Dalea domingensis var. paucifolia, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, pinnately compound leaves. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which is a common trait among legumes. This variety is distinguished by its reduced foliage, giving it a sparse appearance compared to other Dalea species."
