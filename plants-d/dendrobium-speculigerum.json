    "intro": "Dendrobium speculigerum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that often hang from trees, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or protected areas."
