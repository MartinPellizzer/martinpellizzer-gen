    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically gray-green in color. It is often used in dune stabilization and erosion control due to its robust root system. This variety is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Distichlis spicata."
