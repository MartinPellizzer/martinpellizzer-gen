    "intro": "Dodecatheon radicatum, commonly known as the rootflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, stout stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique feature is the underground tuberous root system, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. Dodecatheon radicatum is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
