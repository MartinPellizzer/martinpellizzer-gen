    "intro": "Dianthus polycladus, commonly known as the clustered campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Dianthus polycladus is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
