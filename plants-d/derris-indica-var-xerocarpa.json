    "intro": "Derris indica var. xerocarpa, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its roots, which contain the alkaloid rotenone, used as a natural insecticide. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is handled with care in both traditional and modern applications."
