    "intro": "Diploclinium carnosum, commonly known as the hairy antelope's foot, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
