    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 lunensis, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, elegantly divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance."
