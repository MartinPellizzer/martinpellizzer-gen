    "intro": "Darlingtonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky false pitcher, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that resemble a pitcher, lined with a waxy coating that aids in trapping prey. The plant produces a sticky fluid inside the pitcher to immobilize insects, which are then digested by enzymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and cool temperatures. Darlingtonia glandulosa is also notable for its striking, often red or orange-tinged, flowers that attract pollinators."
