    "intro": "Delphinium intermedium subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. The plant features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
