It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens."
