    "intro": "Didymocarpus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed persipha, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Didymocarpus trilobus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
