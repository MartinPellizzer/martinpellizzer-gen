    "intro": "Daphne cneorum var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
