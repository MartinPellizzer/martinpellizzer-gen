    "intro": "Datura insignis, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and woody. Datura insignis contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
