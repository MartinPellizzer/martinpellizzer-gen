    "intro": "Dryopteris trichopoda, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Dryopteris trichopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
