    "intro": "Davallia undulata, commonly known as the wavy fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates such as soil or stone. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
