It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of delicate, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for both its beauty and ecological value."
