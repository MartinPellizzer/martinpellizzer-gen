    "intro": "Declieuxia daphnoides var. minor, commonly known as the silver fern, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to its fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, red-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
