    "intro": "Diplazium tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua spleenwort, is a rare and critically endangered fern species native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forest ecosystems. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with spores produced on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are essential for its survival."
