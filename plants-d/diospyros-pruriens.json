It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits with a sweet, sticky pulp. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation, hence the common name. The tree is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
