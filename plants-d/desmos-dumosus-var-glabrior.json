It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
