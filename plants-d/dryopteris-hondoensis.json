    "intro": "Dryopteris hondoensis, commonly known as Hondo brake fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
