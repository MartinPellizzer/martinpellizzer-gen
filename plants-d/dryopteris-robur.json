    "intro": "Dryopteris robur, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, hardy fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Dryopteris robur is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
