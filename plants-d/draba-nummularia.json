    "intro": "Draba nummularia, commonly known as the pennyplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, rounded, waxy leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are often borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Draba nummularia is often found in mountainous areas and is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
