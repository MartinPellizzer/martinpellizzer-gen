    "intro": "Dombeya venosa, commonly known as the silky dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Dombeya venosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
