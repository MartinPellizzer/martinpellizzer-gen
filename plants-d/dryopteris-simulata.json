    "intro": "Dryopteris simulata, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
