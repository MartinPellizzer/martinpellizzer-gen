It is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant features large, umbrella-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Dracunculus paludosus is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found near ponds, marshes, and stream banks."
