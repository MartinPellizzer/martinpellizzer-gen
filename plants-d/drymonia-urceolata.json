    "intro": "Drymonia urceolata, commonly known as the cup-shaped fern, is a unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Drymonia urceolata thrives in humid conditions and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
