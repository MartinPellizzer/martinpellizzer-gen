It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a soft, silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
