    "intro": "Drynaria pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria pulverulenta is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating respiratory and skin conditions."
