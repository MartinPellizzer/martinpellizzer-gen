    "intro": "Draba rupestris var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
