It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Draconia littoricola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
