    "intro": "Dendrobium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It thrives in high-altitude tropical rainforests, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
