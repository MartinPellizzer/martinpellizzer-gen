    "intro": "Draba hirta var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are hairy and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The variety dasycarpa is distinguished by its dense, hairy fruits, which aid in seed dispersal in its natural habitat."
