    "intro": "Dryopteris neofuscipes, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a dark brown to rusty-colored margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a compact and dense structure that helps it thrive in humid, temperate climates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
