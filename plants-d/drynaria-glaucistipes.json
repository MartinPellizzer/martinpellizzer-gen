    "intro": "Drynaria glaucistipes, commonly known as the Glaucistipes fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of pale, powdery bloom. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young."
