    "intro": "Dolichos erectus, commonly known as the climbing bean or cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb and support its compound leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Dolichos erectus is valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and iron levels. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules."
