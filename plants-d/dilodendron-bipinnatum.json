    "intro": "Dilodendron bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-pinnate lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate, layered petals. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it its scientific name. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Dilodendron bipinnatum is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
