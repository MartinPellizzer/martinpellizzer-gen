    "intro": "Dendrobium wardianum, commonly known as the Wards' orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Dendrobium wardianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
