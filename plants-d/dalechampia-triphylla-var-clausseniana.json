    "intro": "Dalechampia triphylla var. clausseniana, commonly known as the Mexican bristleleaf, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is known for its adaptability to harsh conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
