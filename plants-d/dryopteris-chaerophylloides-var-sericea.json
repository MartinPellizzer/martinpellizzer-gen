    "intro": "Dryopteris chaerophylloides var. sericea, commonly known as the silky wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is a perennial fern native to eastern North America, particularly in the southeastern United States. The plant features feathery, compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky down, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
