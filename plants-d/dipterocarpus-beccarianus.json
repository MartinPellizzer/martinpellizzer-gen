    "intro": "Dipterocarpus beccarianus, commonly known as the Bornean dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It plays a significant role in the rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy structure. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
