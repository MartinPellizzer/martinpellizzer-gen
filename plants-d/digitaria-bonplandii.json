    "intro": "Digitaria bonplandii, commonly known as the slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Digitaria bonplandii is often found in areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
