    "intro": "Dalea cahaba, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, pea-shaped flowers that range from white to pinkish-red. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodlands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea cahaba is also known for its short blooming period, usually in late spring, and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
