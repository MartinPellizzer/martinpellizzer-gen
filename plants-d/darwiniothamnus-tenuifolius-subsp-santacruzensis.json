    "intro": "Darwiniothamnus tenuifolius subsp. santacruzensis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz thamnogramma, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of central California. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the mild, foggy climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
