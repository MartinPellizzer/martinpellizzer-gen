    "intro": "Distomomischus ciliatus, commonly known as the curly-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered with fine, hair-like structures called cilia, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
