    "intro": "Drimiopsis burkei subsp. stolonissima, commonly known as the stoloniferous drimiopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late summer. It is a low-growing species that forms dense clumps through stolons, making it an excellent ground cover. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
