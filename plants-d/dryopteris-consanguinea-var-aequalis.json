    "intro": "Dryopteris consanguinea var. aequalis, commonly known as the equal fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf woodfern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are arranged in two rows along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
