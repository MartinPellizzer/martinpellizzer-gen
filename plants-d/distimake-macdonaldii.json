    "intro": "Distimake macdonaldii, commonly known as the MacDonald's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, almost ethereal appearance that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the roots of trees or in dense vegetation. Its flowers, which bloom only during specific seasons, are pollinated by specialized insects, making it ecologically significant. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Distimake macdonaldii is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
