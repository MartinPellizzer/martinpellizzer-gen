    "intro": "Danthonia pectinata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft-textured leaves and dense, low-growing habit, often forming mats on the ground. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Danthonia pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
