    "intro": "Dendrobium crispum, commonly known as the wavy leech orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems with a wavy, crinkled appearance, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium crispum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ease of care."
