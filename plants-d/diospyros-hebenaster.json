It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes ebony and persimmon species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are dioecious, meaning they are found on separate male and female plants. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature."
