It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
