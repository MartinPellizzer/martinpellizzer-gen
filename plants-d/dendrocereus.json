    "intro": "Dendrocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and often produce large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Dendrocereus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. They are popular in horticulture for their unique appearance and brief, dramatic blooming period."
