    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa var. oblonga, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oblong in shape, hence the variety name *oblonga*, and are often arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, bead-like fruits. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
