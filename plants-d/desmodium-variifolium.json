It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia. The seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various ecosystems."
