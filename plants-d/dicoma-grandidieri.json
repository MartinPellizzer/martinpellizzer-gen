    "intro": "Dicoma grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar lily, is an endemic plant species found exclusively in the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its robust, fleshy leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. Dicoma grandidieri typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation areas."
