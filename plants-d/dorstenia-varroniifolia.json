    "intro": "Dorstenia varroniifolia, commonly known as the Varro's false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower but is actually a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant has a short, thick, and often hairy stem, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish. Dorstenia varroniifolia is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unusual appearance."
