    "intro": "Deyeuxia aequata, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in two rows. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deyeuxia aequata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
