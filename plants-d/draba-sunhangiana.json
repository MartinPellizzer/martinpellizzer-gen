    "intro": "Draba sunhangiana, commonly known as the Sunhang rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Draba sunhangiana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous ecosystem."
