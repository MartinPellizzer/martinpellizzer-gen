    "intro": "Dryopteris enneaphylla var. pseudosieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's wood fern, is a varietal form of the nine-fiddlehead fern. It is a perennial fern native to East Asia, particularly China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features compound fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure, and its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and adaptability to a range of soil types."
