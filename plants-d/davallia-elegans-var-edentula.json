    "intro": "Davallia elegans var. edentula, commonly known as the toothless fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a feathery appearance, and its leaves are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
