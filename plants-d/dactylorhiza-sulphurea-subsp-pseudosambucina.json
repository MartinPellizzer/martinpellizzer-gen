    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sulphurea subsp. pseudosambucina, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as fens and peat bogs, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy yellow or orange flower that is often adorned with dark markings. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
