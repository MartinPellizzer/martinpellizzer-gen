    "intro": "Dryopteris diversiloba subvar. rhombea, commonly known as the rhomboid wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive rhomboid shape that gives the subvariety its name. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It is often found in coniferous forests and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
