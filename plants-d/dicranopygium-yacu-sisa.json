It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its leaves. Dicranopygium yacu-sisa plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
