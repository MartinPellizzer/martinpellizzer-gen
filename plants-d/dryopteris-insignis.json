    "intro": "Dryopteris insignis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
