    "intro": "Delaportea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by tiny, fleshy berries. It relies on specific host trees, such as oaks and hickories, for water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
