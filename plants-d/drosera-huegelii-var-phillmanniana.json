    "intro": "Drosera huegelii var. phillmanniana, commonly known as the Phillip's sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and appear in late spring or early summer. It is a relatively rare and specialized species, requiring specific conditions to thrive."
