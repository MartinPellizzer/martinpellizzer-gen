    "intro": "Dyckia magalhaesii, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of stiff, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, spathiflorous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardens and collections."
