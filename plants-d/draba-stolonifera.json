    "intro": "Draba stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Draba stolonifera thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
