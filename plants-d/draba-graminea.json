    "intro": "Draba graminea, commonly known as the grassleaf whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, leafy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Draba graminea is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
