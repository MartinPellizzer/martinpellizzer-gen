    "intro": "Dendrobium longicolle, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that grow horizontally and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of its epiphytic lifestyle. Dendrobium longicolle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
