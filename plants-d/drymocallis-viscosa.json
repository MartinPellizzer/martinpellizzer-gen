    "intro": "Drymocallis viscosa, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Drymocallis viscosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
