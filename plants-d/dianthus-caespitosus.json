    "intro": "Dianthus caespitosus, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Dianthus caespitosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
