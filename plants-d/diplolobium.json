    "intro": "Diplolobium, commonly known as the spurred lupin, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Diplolobium species are characterized by their distinctive spurred flowers, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce pods that contain seeds. They are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
