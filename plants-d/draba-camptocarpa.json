    "intro": "Draba camptocarpa, commonly known as the bent-stemed whitlow grass, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky soils and open meadows. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. Its flowering stems are often bent or curved, giving it its common name. Draba camptocarpa is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
