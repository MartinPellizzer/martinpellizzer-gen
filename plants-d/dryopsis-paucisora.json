    "intro": "Dryopsis paucisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryopsis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southwestern regions of Western Australia. It typically grows in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale yellow or cream, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Dryopsis paucisora is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
