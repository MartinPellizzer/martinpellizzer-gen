    "intro": "Diotolotus, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Mesopotamia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom on long, sturdy stalks emerging from water. The plant thrives in shallow, still water bodies and is often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and rounded, floating on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. The diotolotus holds cultural and religious significance in many ancient civilizations."
