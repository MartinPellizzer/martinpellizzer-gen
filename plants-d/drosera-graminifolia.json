    "intro": "Drosera graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name. Drosera graminifolia is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance and easy care requirements."
