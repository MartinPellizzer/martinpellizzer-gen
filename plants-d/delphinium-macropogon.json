It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy blue or violet flowers in terminal clusters, which are surrounded by prominent, spiny bracts. Its leaves are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Delphinium macropogon is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
