    "intro": "Dryopteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
