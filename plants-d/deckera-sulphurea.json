    "intro": "Deckera sulphurea, commonly known as the golden moss or sulphur moss, is a unique liverwort plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow-green coloration, which is due to the presence of a specific type of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along streams. Its structure consists of a leafy thallus that is often carpet-like in appearance, with intricate branching patterns. Deckera sulphurea plays a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
