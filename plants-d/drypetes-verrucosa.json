    "intro": "Drypetes verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in primary forests. Due to its hard wood, it is valued for timber, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
