    "intro": "Digitaria minima, commonly known as small digit grass, is a small annual grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
