    "intro": "Dianella ensifolia f. straminea, commonly known as the narrow leaf flax lily, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically a pale green to yellowish color, giving it its 'straminea' designation, which refers to its straw-like appearance. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps and its tolerance to salt spray."
