    "intro": "Davilla aspera, commonly known as roughleaf dewberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible berries that turn red in the fall. Its bark is rough and fissured, and the plant is often found in moist, wooded areas. Davilla aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
