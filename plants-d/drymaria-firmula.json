    "intro": "Drymaria firmula, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink in color. The plant has opposite, fleshy, and sometimes hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Drymaria firmula is known for its ability to colonize and stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
