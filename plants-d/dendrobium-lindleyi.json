    "intro": "Dendrobium lindleyi, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, erect stem with numerous fleshy, elongated leaves. Its most striking characteristic is its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. Dendrobium lindleyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
