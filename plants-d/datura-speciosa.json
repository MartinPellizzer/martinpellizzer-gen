    "intro": "Datura speciosa, commonly known as the showy datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces egg-shaped berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Datura speciosa is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
