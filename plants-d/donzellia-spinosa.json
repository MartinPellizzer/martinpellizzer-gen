    "intro": "Donzellia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny donzellia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that contains seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Donzellia spinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
