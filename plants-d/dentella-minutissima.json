    "intro": "Dentella minutissima, commonly known as the minute dentate plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
