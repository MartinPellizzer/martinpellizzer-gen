    "intro": "Dendrobium torquisepalum, commonly known as the twisted lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and a few pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, twisted lip that gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
