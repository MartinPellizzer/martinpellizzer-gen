It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
