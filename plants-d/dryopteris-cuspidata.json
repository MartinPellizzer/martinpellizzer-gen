    "intro": "Dryopteris cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive blackish-brown midrib and bright green pinnae, giving it a striking, painted appearance. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the growing season, with the fronds turning bronze in autumn before dying back. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
