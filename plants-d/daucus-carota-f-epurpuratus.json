    "intro": "Daucus carota f. epurpuratus, commonly known as the purple-rooted carrot, is a botanical variant of the common carrot. It is characterized by its vibrant purple or reddish pigmentation in the root, which is due to the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments. The foliage remains similar to the standard carrot, with finely divided, bluish-green leaves. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible roots. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for both garden and agricultural settings."
