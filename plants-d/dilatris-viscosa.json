    "intro": "Dilatris viscosa, commonly known as sticky sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually borne in clusters, producing small, greenish-white flowers. Dilatris viscosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
