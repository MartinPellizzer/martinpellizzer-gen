It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive inflorescence that resembles a hood or a cap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. The flowers are small and clustered, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind."
