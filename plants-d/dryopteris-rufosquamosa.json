    "intro": "Dryopteris rufosquamosa, commonly known as the rusty-woolly wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a rusty-brown, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
