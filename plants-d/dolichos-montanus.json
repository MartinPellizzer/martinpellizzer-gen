    "intro": "Dolichos montanus, commonly known as the mountain bean, is a climbing legume native to the Himalayas. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and twining stems, which help it climb and spread in its natural habitat. It thrives in temperate to alpine regions and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Dolichos montanus is valued for its nutritional seeds and has traditional uses in some local cuisines."
