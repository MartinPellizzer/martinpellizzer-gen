It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
