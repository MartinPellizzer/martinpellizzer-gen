It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
