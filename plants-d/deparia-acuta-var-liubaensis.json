    "intro": "Deparia acuta var. liubaensis, commonly known as the Liubaensian shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and is often found in forest understories. The varietal name 'liubaensis' refers to its origin in the Liuba region, where it has been documented in local flora studies."
