    "intro": "Dicksonia appendiculata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a tall, upright fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height. It features a thick, fibrous trunk covered with a layer of old fronds that give it a tree-like appearance. The plant has a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to various regions in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Its unique structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
