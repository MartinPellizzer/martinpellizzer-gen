    "intro": "Dryopteris scabra var. bifrons, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features lanceolate, serrated fronds that are covered in fine, scaly structures, giving it a distinctive texture. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
