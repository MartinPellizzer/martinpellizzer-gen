    "intro": "Diarrhena maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found along shorelines. The plant features blue to purple flower heads that resemble holly berries, surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Diarrhena maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
