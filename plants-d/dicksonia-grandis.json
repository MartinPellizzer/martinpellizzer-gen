    "intro": "Dicksonia grandis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a towering fern species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The trunk is composed of a dense mass of rhizomes and is covered in a thick layer of dead, fibrous material. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in D. grandis. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
