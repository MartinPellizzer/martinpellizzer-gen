    "intro": "Dactylis pungens, commonly known as spear grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Dactylis pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
