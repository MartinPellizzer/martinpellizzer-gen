    "intro": "Digitalis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and distinctive hooded flowers. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a spurred shape at the back. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Digitalis micrantha is also noted for its medicinal properties, containing cardiac glycosides similar to those found in other foxglove species."
