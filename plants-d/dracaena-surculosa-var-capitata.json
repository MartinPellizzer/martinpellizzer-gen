It features a slender, upright stem with a dense cluster of long, narrow leaves that form a distinctive crown at the top. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
