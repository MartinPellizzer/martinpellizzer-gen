    "intro": "Diplotaxis harra subsp. harra, commonly known as the African rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb with a robust taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water efficiently. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
