It is characterized by its creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and are often arranged alternately along the stems. Dichromena stolonifera is typically found in moist, sandy soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
