It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
