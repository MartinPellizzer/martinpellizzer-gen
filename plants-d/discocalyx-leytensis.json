    "intro": "Discocalyx leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte discocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique disc-shaped calyx that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
