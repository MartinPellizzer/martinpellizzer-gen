    "intro": "Dendrophorbium bomanii, commonly known as the Boman's tree lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is typically found growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is tightly adhered to the substrate, often appearing as a crust or foliose growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for forest health and biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies."
