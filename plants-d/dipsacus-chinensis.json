    "intro": "Dipsacus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese teasel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that encase its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces distinctive, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
