    "intro": "Dryopteris dianae, commonly known as the Dianae wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a compact, upright form. Dryopteris dianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
