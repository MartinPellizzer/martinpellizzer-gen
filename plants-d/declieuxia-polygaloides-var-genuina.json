It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically pink to red in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
