    "intro": "Dendrobium cinnabarinum, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom along its cane-like stems. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium cinnabarinum is prized in horticulture for its vibrant colors and unique floral structure."
