    "intro": "Diotostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diotostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Diostemonaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Diotostemon is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
