    "intro": "Dryopteris rizalensis, commonly known as the Rizal fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
