It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a unique branching structure with multiple stems that form a bushy shape. Diceros is well-adapted to fire-prone ecosystems, often regenerating quickly after burns. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
