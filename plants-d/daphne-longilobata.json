    "intro": "Daphne longilobata, commonly known as the long-lobed daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Daphne longilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
