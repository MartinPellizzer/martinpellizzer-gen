    "intro": "Dendrobium gintingii, commonly known as the Ginting's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing white or pale pink petals with a yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
