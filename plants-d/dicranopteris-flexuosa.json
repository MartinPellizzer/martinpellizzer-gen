    "intro": "Dicranopteris flexuosa, commonly known as the wavy fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wavy fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Dicranopteris flexuosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
