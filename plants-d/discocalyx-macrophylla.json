    "intro": "Discocalyx macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a showy, pale yellow to white flower that blooms in the early morning and closes by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Discocalyx macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
