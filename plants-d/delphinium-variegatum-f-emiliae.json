    "intro": "Delphinium variegatum f. emiliae, commonly known as the Emilia's variegated larkspur, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, sky-blue to violet flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
