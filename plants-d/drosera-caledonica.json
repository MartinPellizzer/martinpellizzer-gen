    "intro": "Drosera caledonica, commonly known as the Scottish sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny glands that secrete a viscous, sweet-smelling dew to lure prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and heathlands. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat."
