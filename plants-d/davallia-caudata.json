    "intro": "Davallia caudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and hairy fronds that give it a unique appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a shield-like shape, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
