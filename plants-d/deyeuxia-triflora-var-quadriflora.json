    "intro": "Deyeuxia triflora var. quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of four to six flowers, giving it the characteristic \"four-flowered\" name. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
