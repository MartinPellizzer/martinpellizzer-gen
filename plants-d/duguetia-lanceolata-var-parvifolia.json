    "intro": "Duguetia lanceolata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved duguetia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lanceolate leaves, which are typically small and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in inflorescences, and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
