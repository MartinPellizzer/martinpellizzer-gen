    "intro": "Dendrobium purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-tinged orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with stems that are often thick and fleshy, capable of storing water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium purpurascens is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in home gardens and greenhouses."
