    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis proles ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments, contributing to coastal stabilization. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, spikelet-bearing branches. It plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
