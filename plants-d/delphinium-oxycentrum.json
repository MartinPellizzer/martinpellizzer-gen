    "intro": "Delphinium oxycentrum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows. Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
