    "intro": "Digitaria acrotricha, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Digitaria acrotricha is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
