    "intro": "Drynaria costulisora, commonly known as the fan-leafed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, fan-like shape that contributes to its ornamental value. Drynaria costulisora is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
