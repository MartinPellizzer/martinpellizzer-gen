    "intro": "Dryopteris discreta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
