    "intro": "Dendrolobium polyneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Dendrolobium polyneurum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
