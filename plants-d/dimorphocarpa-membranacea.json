    "intro": "Dimorphocarpa membranacea, commonly known as the desert rose or the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a fleshy, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Dimorphocarpa membranacea is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
