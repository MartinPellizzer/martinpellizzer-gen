    "intro": "Derwentia derwentiana, commonly known as the Derwent water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Derwent River in Tasmania. It is a member of the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four tiny, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
