    "intro": "Diervilla hortensis var. rubra, commonly known as red inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, leathery leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by dark red berries that persist into winter. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established."
