    "intro": "Dupatya glareosa, commonly known as the shining leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
