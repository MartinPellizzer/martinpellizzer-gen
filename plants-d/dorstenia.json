It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The plants are characterized by their unique, often spiraling inflorescences and their ability to produce a milky latex. Many species are grown as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and interesting growth habits. Dorstenia species typically thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require partial shade to full sun depending on the species."
