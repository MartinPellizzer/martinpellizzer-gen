    "intro": "Diplazium lohfauense, commonly known as the Lhofau fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a cluster of leaves, contributing to its compact growth habit. Diplazium lohfauense is primarily found in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
