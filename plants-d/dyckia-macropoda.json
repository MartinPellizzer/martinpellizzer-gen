    "intro": "Dyckia macropoda, commonly known as the broad-leaf dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces showy, spathiflorous inflorescences with red or orange bracts and small white flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
