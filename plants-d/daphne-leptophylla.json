    "intro": "Daphne leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its winter buds are particularly ornamental, adding visual interest during the colder months. Daphne leptophylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
