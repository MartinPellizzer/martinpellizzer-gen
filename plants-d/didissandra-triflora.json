    "intro": "Didissandra triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered didissandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional Indigenous practices. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a smooth, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Didissandra triflora is considered a vulnerable species."
