    "intro": "Draba pumilio, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and hairy. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. Draba pumilio is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
