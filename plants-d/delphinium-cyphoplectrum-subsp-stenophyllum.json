    "intro": "Delphinium cyphoplectrum subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
