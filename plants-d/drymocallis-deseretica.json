    "intro": "Drymocallis deseretica, commonly known as the Utah goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Drymocallis deseretica is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
