    "intro": "Dryopteris apicalis, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, with the uppermost pinnae being the most elongated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
