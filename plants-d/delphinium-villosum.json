    "intro": "Delphinium villosum, commonly known as the hairy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Delphinium villosum is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
