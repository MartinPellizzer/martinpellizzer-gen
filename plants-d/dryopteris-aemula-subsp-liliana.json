    "intro": "Dryopteris aemula subsp. liliana, commonly known as the Lilian\u2019s wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing clusters on the underside of its fronds. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the Dryopteris aemula complex."
