    "intro": "Delphinium bicolor var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson\u2019s larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling or planting this species."
