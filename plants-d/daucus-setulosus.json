    "intro": "Daucus setulosus, commonly known as the hairy parsley or wild carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. Its root system is slender and often branched, and the plant produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Daucus setulosus is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
