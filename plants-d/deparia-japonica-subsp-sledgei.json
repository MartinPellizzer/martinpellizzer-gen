    "intro": "Deparia japonica subsp. sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the natural habitat."
