    "intro": "Duma horrida subsp. abdita, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
