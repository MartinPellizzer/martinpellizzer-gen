    "intro": "Drypetes lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved drypetes, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
