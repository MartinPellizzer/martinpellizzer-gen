    "intro": "Drosera closterostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish hue, which helps in photosynthesis and attracts prey. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured insects."
