    "intro": "Dryopteris dentata var. urens, commonly known as the Uren's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle."
