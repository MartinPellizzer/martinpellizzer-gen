    "intro": "Delphinium trichophorum var. oxycentrum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has alternate, basal leaves that are hairy and often have a bluish-green hue. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value is appreciated in alpine gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
