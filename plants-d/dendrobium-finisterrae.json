    "intro": "Dendrobium finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
