    "intro": "Davallia squamata, commonly known as the spiky tree fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered with overlapping, scaly leaf bases that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, and are typically dark green with a leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, exotic look to gardens and indoor spaces."
