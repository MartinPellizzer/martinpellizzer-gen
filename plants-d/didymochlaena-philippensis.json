    "intro": "Didymochlaena philippensis, commonly known as the Philippine fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in nutrient absorption. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
