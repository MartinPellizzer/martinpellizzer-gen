    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis var. druceoides, commonly known as the Druce's bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, lance-shaped flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid is often found in peat bogs and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
