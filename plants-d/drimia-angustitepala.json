    "intro": "Drimia angustitepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dragon's tongue plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, narrow leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during dry periods, allowing the plant to survive in arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are often pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
