    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. erecta, commonly known as the erect sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, distinguishing it from the more sprawling form of the typical Drosera intermedia. The plant features sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. These hairs are specialized for nutrient absorption, as the plant supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in fens and marshes."
