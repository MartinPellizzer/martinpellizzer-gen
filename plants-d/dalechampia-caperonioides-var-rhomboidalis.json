    "intro": "Dalechampia caperonioides var. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the rhomboid leaf euphorbia, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped to rhomboid leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
