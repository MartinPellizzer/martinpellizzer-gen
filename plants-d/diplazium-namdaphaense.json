    "intro": "Diplazium namdaphaense, commonly known as the Namdapha spleenwort, is a fern species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Diplazium namdaphaense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
