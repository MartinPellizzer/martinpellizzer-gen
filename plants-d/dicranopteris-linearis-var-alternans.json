    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. alternans, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. The leaves are usually alternate on the stems, giving the plant its varietal name \"alternans.\""
