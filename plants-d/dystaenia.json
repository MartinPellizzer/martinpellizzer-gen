    "intro": "Dystaenia, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a rare and enigmatic member of the Pteridophyta division. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for nutrient absorption. Its delicate, translucent fronds are often mistaken for lichens due to their appearance. Dystaenia plays a minor but ecologically significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil moisture retention."
