    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 rhodostoma, commonly known as the pink Dendrobium, is a hybrid orchid that combines traits from Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium phalaenopsis. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a fragrant scent. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. The botanical name reflects its hybrid origin and its distinctive floral characteristics."
