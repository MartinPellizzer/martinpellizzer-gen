    "intro": "Draba gigas, commonly known as the giant whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Draba gigas typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in harsh environments, contributing to soil stabilization and supporting local biodiversity."
