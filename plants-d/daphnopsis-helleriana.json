    "intro": "Daphnopsis helleriana, commonly known as the Heller's daphnopsis, is a rare and striking member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. These flowers are often accompanied by small, leathery berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. Native to specific regions in South America, it is a sought-after plant for botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
