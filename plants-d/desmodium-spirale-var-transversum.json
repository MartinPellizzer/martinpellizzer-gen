    "intro": "Desmodium spirale var. transversum, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardens and as a ground cover."
