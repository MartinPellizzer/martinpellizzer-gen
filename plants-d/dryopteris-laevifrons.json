    "intro": "Dryopteris laevifrons, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically broad and shield-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris laevifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its dense, attractive foliage."
