It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
