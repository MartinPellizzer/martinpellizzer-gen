    "intro": "Dipcadi goaense, commonly known as the Goa lily, is a flowering plant native to the western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its bulbous stem supports the showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dipcadi goaense is considered a rare and endangered species."
