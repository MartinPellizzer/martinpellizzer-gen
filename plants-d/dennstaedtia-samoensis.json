    "intro": "Dennstaedtia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting symbiotic organisms. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
