    "intro": "Dryopteris meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
