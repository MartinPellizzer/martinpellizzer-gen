    "intro": "Dimeria tenera, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and clustered, showy yellow flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Dimeria tenera is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
