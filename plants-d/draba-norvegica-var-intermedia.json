    "intro": "Draba norvegica var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is characterized by its intermediate morphology between the two main varieties of Draba norvegica."
