    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. subincisa, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
