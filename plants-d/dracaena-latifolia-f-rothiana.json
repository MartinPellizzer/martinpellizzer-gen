    "intro": "Dracaena latifolia f. rothiana, commonly known as the Rothiana dracaena, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub with a distinctive, upright form. It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are often marked with a pale yellow or white margin, giving it a striking appearance. Native to tropical regions of Africa, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of lower light conditions and ability to thrive in moderate temperatures. The plant's foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both indoor and outdoor settings."
