    "intro": "Dryopteris equestris var. heterolepis, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a variant of the horse's tail fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
