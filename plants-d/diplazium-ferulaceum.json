    "intro": "Diplazium ferulaceum, commonly known as the broadleaf staghorn fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a central rhizome that supports the fronds and produces new growth from its base. Its leaves are typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. Diplazium ferulaceum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat."
