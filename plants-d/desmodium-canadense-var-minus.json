    "intro": "Desmodium canadense var. minus, commonly known as lesser hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
