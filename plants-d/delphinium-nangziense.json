    "intro": "Delphinium nangziense, commonly known as the Nangzi larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months. Delphinium nangziense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms. However, like many members of the Delphinium genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
