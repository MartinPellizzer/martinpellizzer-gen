    "intro": "Doryanthes excelsa var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's candleplant, is a striking, tuberous-rooted plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of large, bright red or orange bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting a drought-tolerant nature due to its succulent stems and leaves. Its unique floral structure makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
