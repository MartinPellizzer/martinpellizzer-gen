    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. commutatus, commonly known as the clustered carrot, is a lesser-known subspecies of the carrot plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more clustered umbels compared to the typical carrot. The leaves are pinnately divided and have a mild, aromatic scent. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a wild relative of the cultivated carrot."
