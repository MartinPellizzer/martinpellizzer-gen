It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
