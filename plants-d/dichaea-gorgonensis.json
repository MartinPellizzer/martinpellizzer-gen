    "intro": "Dichaea gorgonensis, commonly known as the Gorgon's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on tree bark, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical treasure."
