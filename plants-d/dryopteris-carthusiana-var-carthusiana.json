    "intro": "Dryopteris carthusiana var. carthusiana, commonly known as the Carthusian shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit and a dense, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
