    "intro": "Dryopteris crinibulbon, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
