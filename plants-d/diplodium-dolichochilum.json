    "intro": "Diplodium dolichochilum, commonly known as the long-lipped diplodium, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often with a slight fragrance. Diplodium dolichochilum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within the orchid family."
