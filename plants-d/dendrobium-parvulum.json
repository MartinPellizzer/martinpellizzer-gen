    "intro": "Dendrobium parvulum, commonly known as the small dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. Its stems are wiry and can grow up to several feet in length, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium parvulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
