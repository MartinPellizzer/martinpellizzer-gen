    "intro": "Dendrophthora marmeladensis, commonly known as the golden bark orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange petals, which resemble the color of marmalade, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
