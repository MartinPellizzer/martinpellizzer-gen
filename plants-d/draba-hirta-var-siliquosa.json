    "intro": "Draba hirta var. siliquosa, commonly known as the silique draba, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. The fruit is a silique, a type of dry, dehiscent pod, which contains several small, rounded seeds."
