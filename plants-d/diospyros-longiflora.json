    "intro": "Diospyros longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are initially green and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its timber and has also been used in traditional medicine."
