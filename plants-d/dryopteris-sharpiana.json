    "intro": "Dryopteris sharpiana, commonly known as the Sharp's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coniferous forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
