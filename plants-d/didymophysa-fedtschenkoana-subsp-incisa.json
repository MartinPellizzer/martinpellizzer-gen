    "intro": "Didymophysa fedtschenkoana subsp. incisa, commonly known as the Shikotan bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Shikotan Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The subspecies incisa is distinguished by its sharply toothed leaves and slender stems. It thrives in moist, cool environments, typically in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
