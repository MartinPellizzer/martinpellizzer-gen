It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal areas and limestone soils. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Danais andribensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
