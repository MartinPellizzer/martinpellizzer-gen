    "intro": "Davallia cicutarioides, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive silver-veined appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, tropical look in suitable conditions."
