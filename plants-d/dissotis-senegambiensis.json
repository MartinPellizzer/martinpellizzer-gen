    "intro": "Dissotis senegambiensis, commonly known as the West African marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its environment. Dissotis senegambiensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in nutrient cycling."
