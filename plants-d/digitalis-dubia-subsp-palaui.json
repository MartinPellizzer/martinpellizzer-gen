    "intro": "Digitalis dubia subsp. palaui, commonly known as the Palaui foxglove, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rocky or mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
