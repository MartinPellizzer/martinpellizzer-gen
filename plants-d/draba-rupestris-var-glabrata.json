    "intro": "Draba rupestris var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has basal rosettes of fleshy, glabrous leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring. Draba rupestris var. glabrata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
