    "intro": "Diplazium mariannae, commonly known as the Marian Islands shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium mariannae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
