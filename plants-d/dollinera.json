    "intro": "Dollinera, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Dollinera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
