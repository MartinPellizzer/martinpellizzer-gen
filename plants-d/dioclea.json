    "intro": "Dioclea, commonly known as the \"sweet water bean,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are characterized by their compound leaves, often with stipules, and produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruits are legumes, containing several seeds, and some species are cultivated for their edible seeds or ornamental value. Dioclea species are often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
