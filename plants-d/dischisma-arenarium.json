    "intro": "Dischisma arenarium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in arid and sandy environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss. Dischisma arenarium is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
