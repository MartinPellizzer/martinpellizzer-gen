    "intro": "Diplazium japonicum var. oldhamii, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its upright, clustered growth habit. It features pinnately compound fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and serrated margins. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, typical of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
