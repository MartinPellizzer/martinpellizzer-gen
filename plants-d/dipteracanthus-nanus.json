    "intro": "Dipteracanthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf dipteracanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often with a white or pale pink coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
