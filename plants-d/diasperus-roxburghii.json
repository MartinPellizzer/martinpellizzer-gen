It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Diasperus roxburghii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
