    "intro": "Dicentra lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang bleeding heart, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features fern-like, trifoliate leaves that are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
