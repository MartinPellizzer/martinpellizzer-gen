    "intro": "Desmodium peripterum, commonly known as the velvetleaf desmodium, is a tropical legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by legume pods containing small, elliptical seeds. It is native to Central and South America and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can play a role in soil enrichment in certain ecosystems."
