    "intro": "Damburneya longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed damburneya, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that can reach several meters in length, composed of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a slender, woody stem with a distinctive, fibrous, and often hollow interior. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly curved, contributing to its overall exotic appearance. Damburneya longicaudata is primarily pollinated by birds, particularly the honeyeater, due to its nectar-rich flowers and bright coloration."
