    "intro": "Dicksonia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
