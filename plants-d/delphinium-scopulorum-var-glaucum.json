    "intro": "Delphinium scopulorum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
