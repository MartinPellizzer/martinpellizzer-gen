    "intro": "Dryopteris squamistipes, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive scaly appearance on the rachis. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Dryopteris squamistipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant."
