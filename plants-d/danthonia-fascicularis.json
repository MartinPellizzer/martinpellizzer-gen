    "intro": "Danthonia fascicularis, commonly known as the tufted grass or dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of South America. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is occasionally cultivated in aquatic and wetland gardens."
