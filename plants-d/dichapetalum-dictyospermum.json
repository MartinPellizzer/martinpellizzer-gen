    "intro": "Dichapetalum dictyospermum, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
