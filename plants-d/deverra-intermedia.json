    "intro": "Deverra intermedia, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands. The plant has triangular stems that are often hairless and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and have a distinct midrib, while its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Deverra intermedia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
