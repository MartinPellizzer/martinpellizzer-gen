It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its slender, spike-like inflorescence produces small, spikelet clusters that are wind-pollinated. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
