    "intro": "Dryopteris cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
