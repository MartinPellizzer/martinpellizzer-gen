    "intro": "Doronicum ramosum, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Doronicum ramosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
