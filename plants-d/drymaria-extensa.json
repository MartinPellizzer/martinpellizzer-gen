    "intro": "Drymaria extensa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a sprawling habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Drymaria extensa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
