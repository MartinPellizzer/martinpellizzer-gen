    "intro": "Dubouzetia elegans, commonly known as the elegant lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped blooms. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dubouzetia elegans is considered a conservation concern."
