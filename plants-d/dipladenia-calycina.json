    "intro": "Dipladenia calycina, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It is known for its ability to thrive in hot, arid conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Dipladenia calycina is also notable for its spiny stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
