    "intro": "Dennstaedtia glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, circular groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, contributing to its common name."
