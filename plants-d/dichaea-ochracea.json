    "intro": "Dichaea ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dichaea ochracea is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
