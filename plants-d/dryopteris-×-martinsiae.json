    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 martinsiae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to form thick, lush clumps over time."
