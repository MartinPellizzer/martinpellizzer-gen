    "intro": "Dendrobium calicopis, commonly known as the calycophyll dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive calyx-like structure around the base of the petals. Dendrobium calicopis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
