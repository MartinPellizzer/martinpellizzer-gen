    "intro": "Dimorphandra multiflora, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and bipinnate leaves that are alternate and often fragrant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to seasonal droughts, making it a hardy species in arid and semi-arid regions. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
