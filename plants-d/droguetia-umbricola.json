    "intro": "Droguetia umbricola, commonly known as the shadow droguetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are typically orange or red in color. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Droguetia umbricola is considered a rare and endangered species."
