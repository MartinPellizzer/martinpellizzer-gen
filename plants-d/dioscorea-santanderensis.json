    "intro": "Dioscorea santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander yam, is a climbing vine native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and bears yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers are valued for their starchy texture and are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. The species is also of interest in ethnobotanical studies due to its potential pharmacological properties."
