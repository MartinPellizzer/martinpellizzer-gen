    "intro": "Deckeria, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Deckeria species are typically herbaceous and grow in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. They are not commonly cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological roles."
