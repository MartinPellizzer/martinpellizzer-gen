    "intro": "Dichaea lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mats of foliage with needle-like leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Dichaea lycopodioides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
