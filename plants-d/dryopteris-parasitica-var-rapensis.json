    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. rapensis, commonly known as the European hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to Europe. It is a compact, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors. The plant features a rosette of leathery, dark green, tongue-shaped fronds that remain throughout the year. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, acidic soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, mat-like growths."
