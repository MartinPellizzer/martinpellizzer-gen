    "intro": "Disecocarpus kotschyi, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a strong fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Rubiaceae family. Disecocarpus kotschyi is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
