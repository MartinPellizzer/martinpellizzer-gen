    "intro": "Degeneria, commonly known as the \"tree of heaven,\" is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Degeneria is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also noted for its allelopathic properties, which inhibit the growth of other plants around it."
