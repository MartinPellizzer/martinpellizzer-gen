    "intro": "Digitorebutia ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to South America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
