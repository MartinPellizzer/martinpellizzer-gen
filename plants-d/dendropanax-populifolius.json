    "intro": "Dendropanax populifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowleaf, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for their purported healing properties."
