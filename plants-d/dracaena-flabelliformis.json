    "intro": "Dracaena flabelliformis, commonly known as the paddle leaf dracaena, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena flabelliformis is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
