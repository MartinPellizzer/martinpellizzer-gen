    "intro": "Dendrobium xanthogenium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium xanthogenium is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and adaptability to cultivation."
