    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces tall, slender stems with a single spike of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive root system composed of fleshy, dark brown rhizomes and fibrous roots, adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The species is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its wetland habitats."
