    "intro": "Draconia halodendron, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Draconia halodendron plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
