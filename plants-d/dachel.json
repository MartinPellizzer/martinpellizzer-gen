    "intro": "Dachel, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tiny, tubular flowers. Dachel produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, fields, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
