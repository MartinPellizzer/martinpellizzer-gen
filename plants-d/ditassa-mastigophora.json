    "intro": "Ditassa mastigophora, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a unique structure that allows for pollination by specific insect species. The leaves are supported by long, hollow petioles that help maintain their buoyancy and structural integrity."
