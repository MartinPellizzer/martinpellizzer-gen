    "intro": "Dryopteris coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It features fronds that are typically narrow and elongated, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are usually curled and protected by a fiddlehead-like structure."
