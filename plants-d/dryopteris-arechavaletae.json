    "intro": "Dryopteris arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
