It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
