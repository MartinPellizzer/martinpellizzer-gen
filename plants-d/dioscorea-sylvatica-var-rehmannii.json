It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the economically important part, are used as a starch source and have medicinal properties in traditional medicine. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
