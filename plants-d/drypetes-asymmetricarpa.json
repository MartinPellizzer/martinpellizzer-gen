    "intro": "Drypetes asymmetricarpa, commonly known as the asymmetric leaf drypetes, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical leaf shape, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract various pollinators. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
