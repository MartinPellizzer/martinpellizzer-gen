    "intro": "Dupatya elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dupatya elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
