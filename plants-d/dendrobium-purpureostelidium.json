    "intro": "Dendrobium purpureostelidium, commonly known as the purple-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive purple or reddish hue on the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
