    "intro": "Draba zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Zahner's rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on slopes where soil is poor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
