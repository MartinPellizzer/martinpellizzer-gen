    "intro": "Dimorphanthera vonroemeri, commonly known as the Cape Peninsula orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that features a single, showy flower. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flower is typically pale green or yellowish with a contrasting lip, and it blooms during the late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
