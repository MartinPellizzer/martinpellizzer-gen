    "intro": "Daemonorops fusca, commonly known as the red-veined cycad, is a member of the palm family, Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive reddish veining. Its cycad-like appearance often leads to confusion with true cycads, but it is classified as a palm. Daemonorops fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
