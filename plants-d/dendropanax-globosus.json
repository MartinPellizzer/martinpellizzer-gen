    "intro": "Dendropanax globosus, commonly known as the globular aralia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Dendropanax globosus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
