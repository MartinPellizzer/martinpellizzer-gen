    "intro": "Dryopteris athamantica, commonly known as the Athamantic wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
