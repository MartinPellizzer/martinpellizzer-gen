    "intro": "Dendrobium guangxiense, commonly known as Guangxi dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to southern China. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often during the summer months. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
