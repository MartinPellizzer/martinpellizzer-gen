    "intro": "Diomedea thurifera, commonly known as the royal albatross, is a large seabird belonging to the Diomedeidae family. It is characterized by its long wings, distinctive white plumage, and a robust beak. This species is native to the Southern Ocean, where it breeds on remote subantarctic islands. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Diomedea thurifera is an animal, not a plant. I can't reply."
