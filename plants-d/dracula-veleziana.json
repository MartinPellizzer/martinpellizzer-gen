    "intro": "Dracula veleziana, commonly known as the Veleziana vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a unique, elongated spur that resembles a vampire's fangs, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically deep red or purple, adding to its mysterious and haunting appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula veleziana is considered a conservation concern."
