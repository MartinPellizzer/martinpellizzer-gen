    "intro": "Deschampsia kurilensis, commonly known as Kuril hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
