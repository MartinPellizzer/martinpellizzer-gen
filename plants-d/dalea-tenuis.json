It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
