    "intro": "Dendrobium magistratus, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive fragrance. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive."
