    "intro": "Datura guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian devil's trumpet, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its striking appearance and potent chemical composition make it both ecologically significant and a subject of scientific interest."
