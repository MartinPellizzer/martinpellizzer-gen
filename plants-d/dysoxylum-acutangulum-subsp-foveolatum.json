    "intro": "Dysoxylum acutangulum subsp. foveolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dysoxylum, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, often serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the species."
