    "intro": "Digitaria ciliaris var. pes-avis, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
