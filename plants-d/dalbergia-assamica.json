    "intro": "Dalbergia assamica, commonly known as Assam rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
