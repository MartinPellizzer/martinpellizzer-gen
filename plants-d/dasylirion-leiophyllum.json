    "intro": "Dasylirion leiophyllum, commonly known as the smoothleaf sotol, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, leathery, bluish-gray leaves that are smooth and lack the spines found in related species. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its foliage and structure make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
