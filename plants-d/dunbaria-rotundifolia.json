    "intro": "Dunbaria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf dunbaria, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. Dunbaria rotundifolia is often found in rich, humusy soils and is considered a valuable component of native plant communities."
