    "intro": "Draba araboides, commonly known as the Arabian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Draba araboides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
