    "intro": "Dendrobium tozerense, commonly known as the Tozer's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that elongate over time, and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and cream. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium tozerense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
