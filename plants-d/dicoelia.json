    "intro": "Dicoelia, commonly known as the broadleaf burr or burrweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that enclose the seeds. The leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Dicoelia species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant's unique morphology makes it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed."
