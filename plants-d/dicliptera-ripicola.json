    "intro": "Dicliptera ripicola, commonly known as the riparian dicliptera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and floodplains, exhibiting a sprawling or ascending growth habit. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are often inconspicuous but attract various pollinators. Dicliptera ripicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
