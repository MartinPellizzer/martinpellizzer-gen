    "intro": "Dendrobium brevimentum, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. Dendrobium brevimentum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
