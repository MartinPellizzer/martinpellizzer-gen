    "intro": "Draba obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Draba obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
