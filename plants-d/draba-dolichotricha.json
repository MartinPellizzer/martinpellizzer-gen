    "intro": "Draba dolichotricha, commonly known as the long-hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered with dense, long hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Draba dolichotricha is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
