    "intro": "Dimorpha tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dimorpha, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a thick layer of fine, soft hairs. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically pink or purple in color."
