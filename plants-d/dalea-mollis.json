    "intro": "Dalea mollis, commonly known as pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. Dalea mollis is a perennial herb that often forms dense clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
