    "intro": "Didissandra lanuginosa var. minuta, commonly known as the silky didissandra, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
