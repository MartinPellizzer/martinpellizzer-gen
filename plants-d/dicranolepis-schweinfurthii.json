    "intro": "Dicranolepis schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's haircap, is a small, mat-forming moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, papillose structures. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stems, and these capsules are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing carpets. Dicranolepis schweinfurthii is a cosmopolitan species, found in various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia."
