    "intro": "Dyckia goiana, commonly known as the Goiania Dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that bear small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Dyckia goiana is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
