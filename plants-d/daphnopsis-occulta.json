    "intro": "Daphnopsis occulta, commonly known as the hidden daphne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a compact and elegant appearance. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, making it a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Daphnopsis occulta is considered a conservation concern."
