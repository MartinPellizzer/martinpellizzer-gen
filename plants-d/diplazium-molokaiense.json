    "intro": "Diplazium molokaiense, commonly known as Molokai sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the forest floor. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplazium molokaiense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in native forests on the island of Molokai."
