    "intro": "Diospyros densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hardy wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
