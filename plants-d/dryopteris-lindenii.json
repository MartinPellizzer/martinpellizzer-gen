    "intro": "Dryopteris lindenii, commonly known as the Lindley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of brownish scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and short, allowing it to form compact colonies. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a distinctive shape that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
