    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 gotlandica, commonly known as the Gotland orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to northern Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. The plant produces tall, erect stems with several lance-shaped leaves and bears clusters of pink or purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is protected in several countries."
