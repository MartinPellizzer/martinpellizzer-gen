    "intro": "Dendrobium pulchellum, commonly known as the orchid of the highlands, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, slender stem with numerous fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
