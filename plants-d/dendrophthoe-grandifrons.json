    "intro": "Dendrophthoe grandifrons, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress on its host tree, sometimes leading to its decline."
