    "intro": "Disa kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. This perennial herbaceous plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
