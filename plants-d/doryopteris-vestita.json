    "intro": "Doryopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually pale green and covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Doryopteris vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant foliage."
