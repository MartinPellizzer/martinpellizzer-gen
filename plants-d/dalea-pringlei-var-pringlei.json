    "intro": "Dalea pringlei var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
