    "intro": "Dendrobium crispulum, commonly known as the wrinkled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate fragrance. Dendrobium crispulum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
