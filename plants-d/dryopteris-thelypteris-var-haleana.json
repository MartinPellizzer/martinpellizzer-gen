    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris var. haleana, commonly known as Hale's shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features large, leathery, deeply divided fronds that are often dark green with a slightly hairy underside. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
