    "intro": "Dryopteris decora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-yellow margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name."
