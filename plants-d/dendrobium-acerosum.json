    "intro": "Dendrobium acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing protection against environmental stress. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Dendrobium acerosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
