    "intro": "Dendrolobium, commonly known as the needlepod or sweetpea bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, primarily native to Australia, with a few species found in New Guinea and Southeast Asia. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Many species produce small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine or as a food source. Dendrolobium species are adapted to various habitats, including arid and semi-arid regions, and some are valued for their ornamental appeal."
