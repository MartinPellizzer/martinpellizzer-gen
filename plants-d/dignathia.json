    "intro": "Dignathia, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Dignathia produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
