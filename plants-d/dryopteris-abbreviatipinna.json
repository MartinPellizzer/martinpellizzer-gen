    "intro": "Dryopteris abbreviatipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
