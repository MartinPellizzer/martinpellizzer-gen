    "intro": "Diclidopteris angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface or along the substrate. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a feathery appearance that aids in light absorption. Diclidopteris angustissima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
