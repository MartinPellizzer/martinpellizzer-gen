    "intro": "Dendrobium aliciae, commonly known as the Alice's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warm season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Dendrobium aliciae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
