    "intro": "Dischidia copelandii, commonly known as the hanging basket vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its aerial roots and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its rapid growth habit makes it popular for use in hanging baskets and as a decorative climbing plant. Dischidia copelandii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
