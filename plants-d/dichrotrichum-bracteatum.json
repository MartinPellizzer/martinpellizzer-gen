It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden landscapes and restoration projects."
