    "intro": "Drynaria palmata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Drynariaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, overlapping scales that resemble bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in strobili at the base of the fronds. Drynaria palmata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
