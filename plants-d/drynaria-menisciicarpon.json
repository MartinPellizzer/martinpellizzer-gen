    "intro": "Drynaria menisciicarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, narrow shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
