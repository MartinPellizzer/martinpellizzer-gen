    "intro": "Delosperma pageanum, commonly known as the Page's ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
