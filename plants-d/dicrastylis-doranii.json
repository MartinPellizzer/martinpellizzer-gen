    "intro": "Dicrastylis doranii, commonly known as the Doran's false lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
