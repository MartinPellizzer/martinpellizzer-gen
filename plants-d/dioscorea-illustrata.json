    "intro": "Dioscorea illustrata, commonly known as the illustrated yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers, which are the primary economic product, are used as a food source in some cultures and have a starchy, sweet flavor. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both traditional agriculture and botanical research."
