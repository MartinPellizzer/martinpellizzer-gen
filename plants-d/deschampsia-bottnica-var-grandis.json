    "intro": "Deschampsia bottnica var. grandis, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that often forms dense mats. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
