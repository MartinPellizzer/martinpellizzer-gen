    "intro": "Dryopteris reticulata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its elongated, slender fronds. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance due to their finely divided leaves. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender fronds compared to the typical form of D. reticulata. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to a range of soil types."
