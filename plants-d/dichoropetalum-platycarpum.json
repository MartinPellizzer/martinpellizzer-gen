    "intro": "Dichoropetalum platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited dichoropetalum, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
