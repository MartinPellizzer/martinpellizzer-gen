    "intro": "Dalea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native region. It has compound leaves and produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
