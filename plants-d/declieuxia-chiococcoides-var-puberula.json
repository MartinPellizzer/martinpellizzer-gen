    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, playing an important role in stabilizing wetland soils."
