    "intro": "Danthonia archeri, commonly known as the mountain grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions. Danthonia archeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
