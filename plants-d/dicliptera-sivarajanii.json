    "intro": "Dicliptera sivarajanii, commonly known as Sivarajan's dicliptera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
