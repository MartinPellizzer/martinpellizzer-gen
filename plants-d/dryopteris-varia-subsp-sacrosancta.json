    "intro": "Dryopteris varia subsp. sacrosancta, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a variant of the variable wood fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
