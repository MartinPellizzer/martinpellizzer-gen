    "intro": "Dryopteris maximowicziana var. rhodolepis, commonly known as the red-veined wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue along the veins, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
