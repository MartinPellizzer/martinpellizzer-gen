    "intro": "Dryopteris guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
