    "intro": "Drosera liniflora, commonly known as the silky sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Drosera liniflora is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
