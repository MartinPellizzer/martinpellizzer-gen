    "intro": "Daphne mezereum var. alba, commonly known as white mezereum, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, gray-green bark and produces small, red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in woodland or shady garden environments and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and early blooming habit, it is often cultivated in horticulture."
