    "intro": "Dendrobium hepaticum, commonly known as the liver orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin stems that can reach several meters in length, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
