    "intro": "Dioscorea uliginosa, commonly known as swamp yam, is a perennial vine native to wetland areas in the Americas. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and often grows in marshy or swampy environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. The tubers of Dioscorea uliginosa are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in various indigenous cultures for food and medicine."
