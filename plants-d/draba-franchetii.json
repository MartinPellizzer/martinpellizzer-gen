    "intro": "Draba franchetii, commonly known as the alpine draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. This species typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, high-altitude conditions. Draba franchetii has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in early spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies."
