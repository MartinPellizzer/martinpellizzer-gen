    "intro": "Demidofia repens, commonly known as the creeping demidofia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
