These plants are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. They are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The stems are typically square and covered in a powdery coating called a bloom. Dictamnus species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and fragrance."
