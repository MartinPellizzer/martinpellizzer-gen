    "intro": "Duguetia caniflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Duguetia caniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
