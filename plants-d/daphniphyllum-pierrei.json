    "intro": "Daphniphyllum pierrei, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that are arranged in a unique whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in cool, moist climates and requires partial shade to thrive. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
