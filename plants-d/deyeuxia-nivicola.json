    "intro": "Deyeuxia nivicola, commonly known as the snow grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Deyeuxia nivicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic and alpine organisms."
