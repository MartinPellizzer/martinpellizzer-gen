    "intro": "Delostoma roseum, commonly known as the rose-colored blister beetle, is a small, oval-shaped insect that belongs to the family Dynastes. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish coloration, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators. The beetle is often found in grassy areas and is known for its ability to produce a defensive secretion when disturbed. Its life cycle includes a larval stage that feeds on decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Despite its appearance, it is not a plant but an insect, and its botanical relevance lies in its ecological interactions with plants."
