    "intro": "Dysoxylum hurlimannii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
