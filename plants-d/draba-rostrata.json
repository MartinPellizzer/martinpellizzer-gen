It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Draba rostrata produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a short, flowering stem that bears white or pale yellow flowers. It is an important part of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
