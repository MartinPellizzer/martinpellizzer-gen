    "intro": "Dodonaea tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved screwtree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Dodonaea tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
