It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Diplachne serotina is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and pasturelands."
