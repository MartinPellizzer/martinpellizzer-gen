    "intro": "Dolicholobium oxylobum, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiny, bract-covered seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dolicholobium oxylobum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
