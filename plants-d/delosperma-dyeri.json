    "intro": "Delosperma dyeri, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Delosperma dyeri is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 30 cm tall, with a compact and spreading growth habit."
