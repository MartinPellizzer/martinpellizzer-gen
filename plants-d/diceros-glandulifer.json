    "intro": "Diceros glandulifer, commonly known as the glandular thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-rowed spikelets. Diceros glandulifer plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
