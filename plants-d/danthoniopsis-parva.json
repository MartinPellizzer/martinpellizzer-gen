    "intro": "Danthoniopsis parva, commonly known as the small danthoniopsis, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-green blades. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
