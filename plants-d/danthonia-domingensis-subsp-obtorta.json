    "intro": "Danthonia domingensis subsp. obtorta, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
