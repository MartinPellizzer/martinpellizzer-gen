    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis lusus alborosacea, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and requires specific moisture and nutrient conditions to thrive. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
