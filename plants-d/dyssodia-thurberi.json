It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
