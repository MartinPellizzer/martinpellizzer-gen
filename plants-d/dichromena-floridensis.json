    "intro": "Dichromena floridensis, commonly known as the Florida dichromena, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
