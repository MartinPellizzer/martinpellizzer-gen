    "intro": "Delphinium wootonii, commonly known as Wooton's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a hairy texture. Delphinium wootonii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
