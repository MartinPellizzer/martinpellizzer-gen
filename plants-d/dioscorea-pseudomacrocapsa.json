The plant has compound leaves with palmate venation and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual. Its tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in various cuisines across Southeast Asia. The species is also valued for its potential pharmacological properties, though further research is needed to fully explore its botanical and therapeutic applications."
