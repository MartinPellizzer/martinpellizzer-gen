    "intro": "Dianthus patens, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or white, five-petaled flowers. The plant has hairy, often blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Dianthus patens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
