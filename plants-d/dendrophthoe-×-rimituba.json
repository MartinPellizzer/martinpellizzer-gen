    "intro": "Dendrophthoe \u00d7 rimituba, commonly known as the hybrid ghost fern, is a rare epiphytic plant that grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent foliage that resembles ghostly veils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
