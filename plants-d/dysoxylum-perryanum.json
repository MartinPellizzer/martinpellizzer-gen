It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, and for its ornamental appeal. Dysoxylum perryanum thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
