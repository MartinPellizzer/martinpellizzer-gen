    "intro": "Diplazium sororium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams, marshes, and damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium sororium is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
