    "intro": "Doryopteris actinophylla, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris actinophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add a tropical flair to gardens."
