    "intro": "Doliocarpus putumayensis, commonly known as the Putumayo doliocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in yellow or orange hues. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody shell. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
