    "intro": "Derris macroloba, commonly known as the giant senna, is a woody shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its roots contain the alkaloid rotenone, which has been traditionally used as a natural pesticide. Derris macroloba is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
