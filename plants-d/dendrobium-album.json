    "intro": "Dendrobium album, commonly known as the white dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, cane-like stems that often branch and bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically showy and bloom during the summer months. Dendrobium album is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
