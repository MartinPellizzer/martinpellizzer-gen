    "intro": "Dryopteris yabei var. matsuzoana, commonly known as the Matsuzoana wood fern, is a variant of the Japanese wood fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
