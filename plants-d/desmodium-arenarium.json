    "intro": "Desmodium arenarium, commonly known as sand burr, is a low-growing annual legume native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines that aid in seed dispersal. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in poor, dry conditions. Its flowers are typically small and pink or white, appearing in clusters. Desmodium arenarium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
