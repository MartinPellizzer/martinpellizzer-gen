    "intro": "Dipsacus ferox var. comosus, commonly known as the bristly teasel, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, burs-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
