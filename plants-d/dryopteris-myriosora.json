    "intro": "Dryopteris myriosora, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and unfurling throughout the growing season."
