    "intro": "Dressleria dodsoniana, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Santa Cruz in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom during the Christmas season, hence its common name. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
