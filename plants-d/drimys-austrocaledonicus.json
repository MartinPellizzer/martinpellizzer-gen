    "intro": "Drimys austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian drimys, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Drimyaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
