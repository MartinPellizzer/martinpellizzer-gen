    "intro": "Danthonia montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and somewhat hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
