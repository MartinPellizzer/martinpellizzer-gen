It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Diplazium sammatii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
