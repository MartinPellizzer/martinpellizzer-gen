    "intro": "Dracophyllum robustum, commonly known as the robust heath, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many heath and shrub species. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Dracophyllum robustum is well adapted to high humidity and shade, making it a common component of understorey vegetation in its native habitat."
