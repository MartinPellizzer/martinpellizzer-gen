    "intro": "Dichaetanthera verdcourtii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique floral structure characterized by its elongated, hairy stamens. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
