    "intro": "Dioscorea macrostachya, commonly known as the giant yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its large, tuberous roots that can grow to impressive sizes. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne on long, branched stems. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, contributing to its striking appearance. The tubers of D. macrostachya are not only ornamental but also have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
