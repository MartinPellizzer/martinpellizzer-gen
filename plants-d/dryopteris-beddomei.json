    "intro": "Dryopteris beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer. Dryopteris beddomei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
