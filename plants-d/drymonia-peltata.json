    "intro": "Drymonia peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown tomentum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. Drymonia peltata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
