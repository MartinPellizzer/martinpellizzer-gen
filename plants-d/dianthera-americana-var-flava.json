    "intro": "Dianthera americana var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a grayish-green hue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
