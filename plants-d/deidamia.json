    "intro": "Deidamia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Deidamia species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
