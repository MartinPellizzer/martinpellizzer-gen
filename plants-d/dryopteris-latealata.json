    "intro": "Dryopteris latealata, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris latealata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
