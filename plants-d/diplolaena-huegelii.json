    "intro": "Diplolaena huegelii, commonly known as the coastal diplolaena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
