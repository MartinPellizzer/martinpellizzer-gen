    "intro": "Dryopteris moulmaynensis, commonly known as the Moulmayn shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
