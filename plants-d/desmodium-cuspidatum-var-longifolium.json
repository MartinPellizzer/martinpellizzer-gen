    "intro": "Desmodium cuspidatum var. longifolium, commonly known as prairie burr, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, appearing in clusters along the stems."
