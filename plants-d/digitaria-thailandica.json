    "intro": "Digitaria thailandica, commonly known as Thai digitaria, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
