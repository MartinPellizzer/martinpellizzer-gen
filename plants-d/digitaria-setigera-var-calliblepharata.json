    "intro": "Digitaria setigera var. calliblepharata, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a common sight in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
