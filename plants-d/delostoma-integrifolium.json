    "intro": "Delostoma integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf blister beetle plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its smooth, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Delostoma integrifolium is often found in association with other members of the Onagraceae family, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
