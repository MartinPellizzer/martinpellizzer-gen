It belongs to the family Lardizabalaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
