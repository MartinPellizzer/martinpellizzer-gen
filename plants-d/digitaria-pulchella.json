    "intro": "Digitaria pulchella, commonly known as the pretty grass or slender digitgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, spreading stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are usually light green to brown in color. Digitaria pulchella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland environments."
