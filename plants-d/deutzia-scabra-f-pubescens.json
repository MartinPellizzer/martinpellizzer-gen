It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blossoms and attractive foliage, which provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
