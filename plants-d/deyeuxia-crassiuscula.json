    "intro": "Deyeuxia crassiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds, streams, and damp meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a compact rosette structure. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. Deyeuxia crassiuscula plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
