    "intro": "Dicksonia umbrosa, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's growth and enabling it to store water. The fronds are typically bright green, with a velvety texture that helps in capturing moisture from the air."
