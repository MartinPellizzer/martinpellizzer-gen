    "intro": "Durabaculum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved durabaculum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its large, flat, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
