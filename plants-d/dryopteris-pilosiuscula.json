    "intro": "Dryopteris pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
