    "intro": "Digitalis lutescens, commonly known as the yellow foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
