It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
