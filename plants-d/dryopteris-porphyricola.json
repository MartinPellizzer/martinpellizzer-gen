    "intro": "Dryopteris porphyricola, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that turn a deep red or purple during the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
