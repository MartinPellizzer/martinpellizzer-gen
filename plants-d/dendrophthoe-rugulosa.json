    "intro": "Dendrophthoe rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to various host plants, primarily in the legume family. It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, hairy stem covered in tiny, thread-like branches. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host plant and then developing a specialized structure to penetrate the host's tissues. Dendrophthoe rugulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can thrive on a variety of plant hosts."
