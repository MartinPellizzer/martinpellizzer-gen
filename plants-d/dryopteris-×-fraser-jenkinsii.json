    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 fraser-jenkinsii, commonly known as the Fraser-Jenkins shield fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Dryopteris fraseri and Dryopteris jenkinsii. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
