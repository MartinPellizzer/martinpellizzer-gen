    "intro": "Dracula houtteana, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its intricate, velvety petals that resemble the scales of a dragon, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces striking red and orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, often in clusters along its hanging stems. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
