    "intro": "Dichanthelium leucoblepharis, commonly known as the white-eyed panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in moist environments. The species is characterized by its distinctive white or pale-colored lemma, which gives it its common name."
