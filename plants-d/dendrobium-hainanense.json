    "intro": "Dendrobium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered with a layer of white or yellowish tissue, known as a pseudobulb. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
