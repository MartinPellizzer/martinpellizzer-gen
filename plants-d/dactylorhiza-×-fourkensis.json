It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza viridiflora. The plant typically grows in wet, peaty or marshy habitats and has tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish and are arranged in a loose spike. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 fourkensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, acidic soil."
