    "intro": "Digitaria consanguinea, commonly known as African ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and grassland habitats. Digitaria consanguinea is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
