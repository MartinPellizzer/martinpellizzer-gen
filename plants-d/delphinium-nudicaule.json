    "intro": "Delphinium nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that are nearly leafless, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium nudicaule thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
