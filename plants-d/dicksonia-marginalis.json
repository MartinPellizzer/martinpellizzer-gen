    "intro": "Dicksonia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a pale margin that gives it its common name. Dicksonia marginalis thrives in humid climates and is often found in forested areas with high levels of rainfall."
