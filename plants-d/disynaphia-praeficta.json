    "intro": "Disynaphia praeficta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
