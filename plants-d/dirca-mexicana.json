    "intro": "Dirca mexicana, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright blue, fleshy berries in the summer. These berries are edible for humans and birds but are not commonly consumed due to their mild toxicity. Dirca mexicana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
