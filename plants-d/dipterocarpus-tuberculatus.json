It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is typically found in lowland evergreen rainforests. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
