    "intro": "Danthonia canadensis, commonly known as Canada bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of native plant communities. Danthonia canadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and habitat provision for wildlife."
