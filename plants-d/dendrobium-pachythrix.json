    "intro": "Dendrobium pachythrix, commonly known as the slender spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender spikes that bear numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium pachythrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
