It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Dichrostachys tenuifolia is also used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
