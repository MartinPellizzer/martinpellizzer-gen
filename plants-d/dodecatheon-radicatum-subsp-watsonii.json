It features showy, pink to purple flowers that resemble stars, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces elongated flower stalks that rise above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Greek word for \"twelve,\" likely referencing the number of petals in its flowers."
