    "intro": "Dryopteris klossii, commonly known as the Kloss shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae that give the plant a lush, textured appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
