    "intro": "Dorstenia poinsettiifolia var. achoundongiana, commonly known as the African violet-like orchid, is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its striking, velvety, violet-colored bracts that resemble those of the poinsettia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, contrasting with the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant among collectors and enthusiasts of exotic flora."
