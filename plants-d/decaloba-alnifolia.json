    "intro": "Decaloba alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of alders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in riparian habitats."
