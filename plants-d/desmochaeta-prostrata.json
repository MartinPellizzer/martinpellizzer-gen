    "intro": "Desmochaeta prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate desmochaeta, is a low-growing flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks."
