    "intro": "Dryopteris microstegia, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddleheads that unfurl into compound leaves. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas."
