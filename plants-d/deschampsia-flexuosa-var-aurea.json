    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa var. aurea, commonly known as golden bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, silver-green blades with a distinctive golden tinge along the midrib, which becomes more pronounced in full sun. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and other moist habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
