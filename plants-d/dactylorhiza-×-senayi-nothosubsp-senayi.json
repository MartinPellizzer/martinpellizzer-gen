    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 senayi nothosubsp. senayi, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and bogs. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Dactylorhiza fuchsii and Dactylorhiza maculata."
