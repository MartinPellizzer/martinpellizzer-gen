    "intro": "Dryopteris syrmatica var. petiolosa, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded gardens."
