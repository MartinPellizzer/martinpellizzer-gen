    "intro": "Dichanthelium commonsianum var. euchlamydeum, commonly known as the common panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its flowers lack conspicuous bracts, and the lemma is usually glabrous or only slightly hairy. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
