    "intro": "Demidovia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique and striking flowers, which often have a ghostly appearance due to their pale coloration and unusual shape. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions in Africa and Madagascar. They produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a persistent calyx. Demidovia species are noted for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for their unusual floral displays."
