    "intro": "Dortmanna racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with small, rounded leaves that help reduce water resistance. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a raceme, which is a key feature in its common name."
