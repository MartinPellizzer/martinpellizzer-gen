    "intro": "Dryopteris silvatica, commonly known as the silvery wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread slowly through underground stolons. The fronds emerge in spring, unfurling into a graceful, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
