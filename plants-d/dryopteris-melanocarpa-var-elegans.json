    "intro": "Dryopteris melanocarpa var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant wood fern, is a variant of the barren bladder fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in shaded, moist environments. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its elegant appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
