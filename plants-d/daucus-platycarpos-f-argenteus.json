    "intro": "Daucus platycarpos f. argenteus, commonly known as the silver carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot characterized by its distinctive silvery foliage. This plant is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a feathery appearance, while the stems are upright and somewhat hairy. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
