    "intro": "Dendrobium purpureoflavescens, commonly known as the purple-yellow dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and dense clusters of fleshy, pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and yellow, often with a yellow throat, during the warm season. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate."
