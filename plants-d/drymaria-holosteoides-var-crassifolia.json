    "intro": "Drymaria holosteoides var. crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved sandspurry, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Small white or pink flowers appear in clusters, typically during spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats."
