    "intro": "Dryopteris apiifolia, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year producing only fronds and the second year producing spores. The plant features compound, pinnately divided fronds that are often bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, soft texture."
