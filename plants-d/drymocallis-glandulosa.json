It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have glandular dots, which give it its scientific name.
