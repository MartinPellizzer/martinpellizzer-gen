    "intro": "Dendrocolla amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping tree fern, is a unique species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the fronds, and it relies on wind for pollination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
