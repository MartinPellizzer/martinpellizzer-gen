    "intro": "Dombeya gallana var. floribunda, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy clusters of white, woolly flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its winter flowering display."
