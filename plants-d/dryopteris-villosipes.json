    "intro": "Dryopteris villosipes, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
