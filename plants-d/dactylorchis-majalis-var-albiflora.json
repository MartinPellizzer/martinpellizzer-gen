    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered duck orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with a single, fleshy rhizome and produces small, pale white or cream-colored flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically clustered in a raceme and are characterized by their intricate, orchid-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
