    "intro": "Digitaria hispida, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Digitaria hispida is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife and livestock."
