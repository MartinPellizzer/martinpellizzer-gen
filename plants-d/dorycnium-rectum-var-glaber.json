It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that mature in late summer. Dorycnium rectum var. glaber is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
