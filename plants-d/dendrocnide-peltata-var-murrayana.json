    "intro": "Dendrocnide peltata var. murrayana, commonly known as the Murray's stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle found in the eastern regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, hollow hairs that release a potent irritant when touched. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by humans and livestock."
