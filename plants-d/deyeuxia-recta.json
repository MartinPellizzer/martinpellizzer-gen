    "intro": "Deyeuxia recta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false rice, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deyeuxia recta is often found in moist soils near streams, marshes, or along the edges of rice fields. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
