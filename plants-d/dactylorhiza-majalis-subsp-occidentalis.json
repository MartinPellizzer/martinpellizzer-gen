    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with several narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing showy, pale pink to white flowers. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often being more prominent. This orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions with a humid climate."
