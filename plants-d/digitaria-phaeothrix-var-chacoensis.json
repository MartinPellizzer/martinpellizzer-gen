    "intro": "Digitaria phaeothrix var. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Chaco region of Argentina and Paraguay. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed glumes, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization in its native environment."
