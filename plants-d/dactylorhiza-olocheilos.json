It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and tall spikes of fragrant, purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring calcareous soils. It has a complex root system with a prominent rhizome, which helps it store nutrients and water. Dactylorhiza olocheilos is often found in association with other orchid species in moist, temperate environments."
