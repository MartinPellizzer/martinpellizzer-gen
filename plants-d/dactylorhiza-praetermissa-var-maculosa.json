    "intro": "Dactylorhiza praetermissa var. maculosa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The spotted orchid is a protected species in many countries due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
