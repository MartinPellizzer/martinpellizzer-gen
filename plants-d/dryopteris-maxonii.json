    "intro": "Dryopteris maxonii, commonly known as the Maxon's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
