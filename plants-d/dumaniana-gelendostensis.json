    "intro": "Dumaniana gelendostensis, commonly known as the Gelendostan dumanian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
