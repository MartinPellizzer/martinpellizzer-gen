    "intro": "Dryopteris diversisora, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, often irregular pattern of pinnae that vary in size and shape. The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters known as indusia."
