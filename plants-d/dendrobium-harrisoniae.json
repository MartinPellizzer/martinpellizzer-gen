    "intro": "Dendrobium harrisoniae, commonly known as the Harrison's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It features a tall, cane-like stem with numerous nodes and is characterized by its long, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings."
