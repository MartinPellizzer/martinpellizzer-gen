    "intro": "Dendrophthoe lonchiphylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dendrophthoeciaceae and is characterized by its lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it relies on its host tree for nutrients and water, often growing in dense clusters on the bark. Its reproductive structures are small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the production of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
