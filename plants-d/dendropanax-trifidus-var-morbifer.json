    "intro": "Dendropanax trifidus var. morbifer, commonly known as the toxic devil's ivy, is a variant of the evergreen vine native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are highly toxic to humans and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant, though its toxicity poses significant risks. Due to its harmful properties, it is often avoided in both horticulture and natural environments."
