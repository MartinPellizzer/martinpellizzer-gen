It is a striking plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena boerhaavei thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
