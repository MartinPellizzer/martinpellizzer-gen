    "intro": "Drymonia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
