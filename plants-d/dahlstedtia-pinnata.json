    "intro": "Dahlstedtia pinnata, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Dahlstedtia pinnata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
