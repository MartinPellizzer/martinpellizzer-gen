    "intro": "Dryopteris rodigasiana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of pinnae and pinnules."
