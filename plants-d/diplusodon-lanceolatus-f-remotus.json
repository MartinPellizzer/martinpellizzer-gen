    "intro": "Diplusodon lanceolatus f. remotus, commonly known as the remote lanceleaf, is a rare fern species characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This fern produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
