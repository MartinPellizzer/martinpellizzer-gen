    "intro": "Dendrobium nareshbahadurii, commonly known as the Nareshbahadur's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, clustered growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude, semi-shaded habitat. It prefers cool temperatures and high humidity, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
