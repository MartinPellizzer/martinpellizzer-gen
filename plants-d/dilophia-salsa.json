    "intro": "Dilophia salsa, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and grayish-green, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Dilophia salsa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
