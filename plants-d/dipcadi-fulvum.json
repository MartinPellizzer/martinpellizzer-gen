    "intro": "Dipcadi fulvum, commonly known as the yellow squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to yellow. The plant produces a cluster of small, white flowers at the top of a leafless stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The yellow squill is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
