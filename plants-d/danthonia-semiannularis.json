    "intro": "Danthonia semiannularis, commonly known as the ringed muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense, mat-like tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
