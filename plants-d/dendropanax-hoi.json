    "intro": "Dendropanax hoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a crown of fronds at the top of its trunk, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native, often arid environment. Dendropanax hoi is typically found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories."
