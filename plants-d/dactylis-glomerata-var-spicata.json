    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. spicata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and forage value, it is widely used in agricultural and horticultural settings."
