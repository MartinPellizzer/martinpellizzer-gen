    "intro": "Diaphananthe pellucida, commonly known as the glassy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Diaphananthe pellucida is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
