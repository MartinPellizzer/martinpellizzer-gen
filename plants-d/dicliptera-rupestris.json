    "intro": "Dicliptera rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to rocky soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Dicliptera rupestris is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
