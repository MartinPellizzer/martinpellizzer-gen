    "intro": "Dalea alba, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Dalea alba is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
