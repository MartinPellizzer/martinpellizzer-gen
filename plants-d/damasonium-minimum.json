    "intro": "Damasonium minimum, commonly known as the lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering nutrients. Damasonium minimum is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
