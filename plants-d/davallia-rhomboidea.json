    "intro": "Davallia rhomboidea, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped fronds and a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread gradually. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
