    "intro": "Dryopteris gonophora, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance that gives the species its common name."
