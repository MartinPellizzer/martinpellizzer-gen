It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule. Duckeella humboldtii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
