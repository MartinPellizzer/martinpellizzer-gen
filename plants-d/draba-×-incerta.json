    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 incerta, commonly known as the hybrid rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba auriculata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its hybrid origin, Draba \u00d7 incerta shows genetic variability and is often found in areas where the parent species overlap."
