    "intro": "Drepanophyllum medium, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals. It is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Europe. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to the formation of dense clusters on tree branches."
