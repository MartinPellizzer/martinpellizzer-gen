It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Deeringia virgata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
