    "intro": "Dryopteris hewittii, commonly known as Hewitt's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia that are clustered in sori, typical of the Dryopteris genus. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
