    "intro": "Dryopteris devolvens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that gives the plant a refined aesthetic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it a valuable addition to rain gardens and naturalized landscapes."
