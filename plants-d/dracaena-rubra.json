    "intro": "Dracaena rubra, commonly known as the red dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically green with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena rubra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
