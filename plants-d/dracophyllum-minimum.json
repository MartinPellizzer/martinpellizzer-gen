    "intro": "Dracophyllum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf dracophyllum, is a small shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
