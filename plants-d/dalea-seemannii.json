It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
