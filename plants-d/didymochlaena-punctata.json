    "intro": "Didymochlaena punctata, commonly known as the spotted fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lobed segments, giving it a lace-like appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
