    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. congesta, commonly known as purple grass or sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop for livestock."
