    "intro": "Dryopteris nipponensis, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
