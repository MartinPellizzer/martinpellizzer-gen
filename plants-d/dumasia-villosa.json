    "intro": "Dumasia villosa, commonly known as the hairy dumasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Dumasia villosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
