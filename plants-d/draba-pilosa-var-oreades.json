    "intro": "Draba pilosa var. oreades, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
