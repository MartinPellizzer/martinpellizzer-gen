    "intro": "Dimorphocalyx luzoniensis var. trichocarpus, commonly known as the Luzon mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in montane forests and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. It produces small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
