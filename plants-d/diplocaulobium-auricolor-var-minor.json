    "intro": "Diplocaulobium auricolor var. minor, commonly known as the lesser golden-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its intricate fronds and vibrant golden hues. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate structure that reflects its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits. Its unique coloration and subtle morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful preservation."
