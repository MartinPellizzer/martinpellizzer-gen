    "intro": "Dipsacus arcimusci, commonly known as the hooked teasel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the burdock family (Araliaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bristly seed heads that form after the flowers fade. These seed heads have historically been used in textile processing to raise the nap of fabrics."
