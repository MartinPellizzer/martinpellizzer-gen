    "intro": "Diplazium thelypteroides, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
