    "intro": "Draba pterosperma, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, white or yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release tiny seeds. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette of basal leaves."
