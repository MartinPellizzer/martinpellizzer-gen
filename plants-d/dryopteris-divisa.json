    "intro": "Dryopteris divisa, commonly known as the divided wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris divisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes."
