    "intro": "Dendrobium violascens, commonly known as the violet orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stems. Dendrobium violascens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
