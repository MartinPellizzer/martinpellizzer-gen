    "intro": "Dendrobium roseocalcar, commonly known as the rose-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that produce multiple leaves and flower spikes. Its flowers are showy, with a pinkish-red color and a distinctive, spurred lip. Dendrobium roseocalcar thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
