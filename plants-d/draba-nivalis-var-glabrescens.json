    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous snow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high elevations, typically above the tree line. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
