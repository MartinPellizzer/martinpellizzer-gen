    "intro": "Danthonia americana, commonly known as American feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted flower heads that resemble small plumes. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Danthonia americana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
