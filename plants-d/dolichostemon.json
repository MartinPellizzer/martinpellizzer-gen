    "intro": "Dolichostemon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Dolichostemon is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
