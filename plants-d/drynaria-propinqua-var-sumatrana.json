It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, often with a distinctive midrib. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
