    "intro": "Drymoglossum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock surfaces. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, elongated leaves that are usually green to yellowish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Drymoglossum rigidum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
