    "intro": "Dendrobium imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium imbricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
