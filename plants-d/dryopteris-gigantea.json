    "intro": "Dryopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and large, deeply lobed, dark green fronds that can reach lengths of up to three feet. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add texture and height to shaded garden landscapes."
