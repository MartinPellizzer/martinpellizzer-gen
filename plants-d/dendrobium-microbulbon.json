    "intro": "Dendrobium microbulbon, commonly known as the miniature bulblet orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a fragrant scent. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium microbulbon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
