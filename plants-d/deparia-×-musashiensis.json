    "intro": "Deparia \u00d7 musashiensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Japan. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
