It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
