    "intro": "Dalea purpusii, commonly known as Purpus's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions, and its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind. Dalea purpusii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
