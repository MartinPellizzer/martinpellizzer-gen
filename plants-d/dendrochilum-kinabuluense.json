    "intro": "Dendrochilum kinabuluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of yellow and white, which appear during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
