    "intro": "Dodonaea ptarmicifolia var. subintegra, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
