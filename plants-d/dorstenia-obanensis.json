    "intro": "Dorstenia obanensis, commonly known as the Oban mountain fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
