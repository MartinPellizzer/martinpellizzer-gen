    "intro": "Drosanthemum anomalum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
