    "intro": "Dracula chestertonii, commonly known as the Chesterton's dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vivid red sepals and petals, which resemble the appearance of a bat's wing, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
