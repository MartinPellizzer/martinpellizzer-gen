    "intro": "Discopleura juncea, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters. Discopleura juncea is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, adapting to nutrient-poor environments."
