    "intro": "Dacryodes oblongifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The tree is also valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
