    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 rarissima, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow to gold-colored fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green undersides. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and rock gardens. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. This ornamental fern is valued for its striking foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
