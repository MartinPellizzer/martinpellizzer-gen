    "intro": "Dryopteris ludoviciana, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, upright growth habit with glossy, dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds in the summer, which are typically shorter and more compact than the sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The Southern Shield Fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
