It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in protein and nutrients, similar to traditional quinoa species. It thrives in cool, arid climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Dicliptera quitensis is valued both for its nutritional content and its potential in sustainable agriculture."
