    "intro": "Dendrobium heterocaulon, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, wiry stem with dense clusters of dark purple or brown flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the summer months. Dendrobium heterocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
