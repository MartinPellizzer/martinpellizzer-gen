    "intro": "Drosera margaritacea, commonly known as the dewy rose or the silver leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions that give it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Drosera margaritacea is known for its ability to photosynthesize and supplement its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
