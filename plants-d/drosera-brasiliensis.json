    "intro": "Drosera brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments and has a rosette structure with long, slender leaves. It produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Drosera brasiliensis is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ecological role."
