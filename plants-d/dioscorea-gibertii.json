    "intro": "Dioscorea gibertii, commonly known as the African yam vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some regions. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical fruits. Its tubers are similar in appearance to yams but are typically smaller and have a different flavor profile. Dioscorea gibertii is often cultivated for its nutritional value and is an important crop in local agriculture."
