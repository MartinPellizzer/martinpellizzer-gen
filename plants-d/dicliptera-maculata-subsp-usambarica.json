    "intro": "Dicliptera maculata subsp. usambarica, commonly known as the Usambara dikili, is a perennial herb native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
