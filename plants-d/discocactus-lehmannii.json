    "intro": "Discocactus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's discocactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical shape and features a thick, ribbed stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
