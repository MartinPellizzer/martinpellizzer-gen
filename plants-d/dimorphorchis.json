    "intro": "Dimorphorchis, commonly known as the orchid with two forms, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their unique floral structure, which often includes two distinct forms of flowers on the same inflorescence. The genus comprises several species, each with varying morphological features, including differences in color, size, and shape of the petals and sepals. Dimorphorchis species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found in tropical rainforests. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in the biodiversity of their native ecosystems."
