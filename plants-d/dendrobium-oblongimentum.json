    "intro": "Dendrobium oblongimentum, commonly known as the oblong-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium oblongimentum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
