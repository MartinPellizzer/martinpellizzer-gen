    "intro": "Dryopteris harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
