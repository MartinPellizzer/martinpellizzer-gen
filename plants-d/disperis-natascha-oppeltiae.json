    "intro": "Disperis natascha-oppeltiae, commonly known as the Oppelt's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant features elongated, pendant flowers with intricate, violet-blue petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Its growth habit is terrestrial, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
