    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. stipulosa, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a perennial aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality. The fern's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
