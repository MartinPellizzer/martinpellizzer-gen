    "intro": "Davallia henryana, commonly known as the Henry's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant features rhizomes that grow horizontally and produce spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Davallia henryana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ease of care."
