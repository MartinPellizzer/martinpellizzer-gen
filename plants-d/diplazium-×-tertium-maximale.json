    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 tertium-maximale, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium tertium and Diplazium maximale. It is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable seeds."
