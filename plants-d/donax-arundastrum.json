    "intro": "Donax arundastrum, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches, with a smooth, often grayish underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Donax arundastrum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources."
