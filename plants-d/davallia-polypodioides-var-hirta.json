    "intro": "Davallia polypodioides var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a soft, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, tropical appearance throughout the year."
