    "intro": "Dendrophthoe repanda, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large sections of its host's branches. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its sticky seeds are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
