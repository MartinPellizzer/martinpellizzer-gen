    "intro": "Dipanax kavaiensis, commonly known as the Kava kava plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a climbing shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody fruits. Its most notable feature is the presence of a milky sap, which contains the bioactive compounds responsible for its traditional use in ceremonial and medicinal contexts. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in both ecological systems and cultural practices across its native range."
