    "intro": "Dialium maingayi, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they fall to the ground, as they are not typically picked when ripe. The fruit has a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild flavor, and the seeds are often used in traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
