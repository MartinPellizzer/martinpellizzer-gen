    "intro": "Diplacus bigelovii, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble brush strokes. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Diplacus bigelovii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
