    "intro": "Dimorphandra oleifera, commonly known as the oil bean tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces large, pod-like fruits that contain a hard, oily seed. It is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of vegetable oil. The tree is also important in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils."
