    "intro": "Daucus gingidium subsp. gummifer, commonly known as the gummed cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and wastelands, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its subspecies name, *gummifer*, refers to the presence of a gum-like substance in its tissues, which is a distinguishing botanical feature."
