    "intro": "Diospyros latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it can grow up to 15 meters tall in suitable conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
