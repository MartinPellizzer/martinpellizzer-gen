    "intro": "Digitaria minoriflora, commonly known as the small-flower buffalograss, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in dry prairies and open woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Digitaria minoriflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
