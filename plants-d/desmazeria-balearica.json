    "intro": "Desmazeria balearica, commonly known as the Balearic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky and coastal environments, showcasing adaptations to saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Desmazeria balearica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
