It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, large, white spathe that encloses a cluster of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. Dracunculus spadiceus is prized for its ornamental value and thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
