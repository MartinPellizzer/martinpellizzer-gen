    "intro": "Distylodon, commonly known as the \"two-styled\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which includes two styles of different lengths, a feature that contributes to its pollination strategy. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with pale or greenish hues. Distylodon species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. These plants are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and forest understories."
