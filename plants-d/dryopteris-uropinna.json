    "intro": "Dryopteris uropinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia on the underside, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a finely divided, feather-like appearance."
