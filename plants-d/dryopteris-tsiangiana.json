    "intro": "Dryopteris tsiangiana, commonly known as the Tsiang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance."
