    "intro": "Dryopteris oligantha, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
