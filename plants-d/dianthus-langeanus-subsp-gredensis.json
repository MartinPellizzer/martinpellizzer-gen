    "intro": "Dianthus langeanus subsp. gredensis, commonly known as the Gredensian campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It has slender stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
