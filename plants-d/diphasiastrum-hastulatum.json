    "intro": "Diphasiastrum hastulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
