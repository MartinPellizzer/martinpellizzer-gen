    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called tentacles, which produce the adhesive substance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera rotundifolia is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
