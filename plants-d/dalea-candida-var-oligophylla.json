    "intro": "Dalea candida var. oligophylla, commonly known as the white prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate white to pale pink flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It has small, hairy stems and produces legumes as its fruit, contributing to nitrogen fixation in the soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
