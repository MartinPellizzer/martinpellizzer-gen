    "intro": "Danthonia \u00d7 breviaristata f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of the narrowleaf grass, is a botanical variant characterized by its production of cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinated. This form is a naturally occurring hybrid between Danthonia breviaristata and Danthonia arenicola, resulting in a plant with intermediate morphological traits. It typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, exhibiting a low, compact growth habit. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its ecological significance lies in its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems through soil binding and habitat provision for small invertebrates."
