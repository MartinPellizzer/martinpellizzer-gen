    "intro": "Dalbergia chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with bipinnate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role within local ecosystems and its economic importance in traditional and modern woodworking industries."
