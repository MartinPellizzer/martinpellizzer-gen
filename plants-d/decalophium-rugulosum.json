    "intro": "Decalophium rugulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf decalophium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, organic soils. The plant features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in loose panicles and bloom in late summer. Decalophium rugulosum is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its value in native plant gardens."
