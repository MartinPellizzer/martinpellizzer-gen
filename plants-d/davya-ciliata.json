    "intro": "Davya ciliata, commonly known as the hairy davya, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive spurred shape. Davya ciliata is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions."
