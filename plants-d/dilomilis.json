    "intro": "Dilomilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grasses. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Dilomilis is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
