It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and sagebrush steppe habitats. The plant features slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seedpods that split open to release seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
