    "intro": "Distichorchis igneonivea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often blooming on the trunks of trees in wetland habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and environmental sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
