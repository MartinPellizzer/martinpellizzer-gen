It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests, adapting to humid and warm climates. Its fronds are long and narrow, often displaying a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of specialized structures called trichomes. This variant is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and is also studied for its ecological importance in its native habitat."
