    "intro": "Dracaena cantrellii, commonly known as the Cantrell's dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the island of Socotra, Yemen, and is characterized by its distinctive, upright growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often followed by red or orange fruits. Dracaena cantrellii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
