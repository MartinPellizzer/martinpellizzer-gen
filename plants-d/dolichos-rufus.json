    "intro": "Dolichos rufus, commonly known as the red-brown dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces elongated, bean-like pods that are typically reddish in color, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with several oval-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Dolichos rufus is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
