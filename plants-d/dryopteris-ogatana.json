    "intro": "Dryopteris ogatana, commonly known as the Japanese wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and often have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance with a slightly curled tip."
