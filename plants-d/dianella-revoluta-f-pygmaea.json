    "intro": "Dianella revoluta f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flax lily, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, and it produces striking, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers. The plant grows low to the ground, forming dense clumps that are well-suited for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the year, making it a desirable ornamental plant in shady or partially sunny conditions."
