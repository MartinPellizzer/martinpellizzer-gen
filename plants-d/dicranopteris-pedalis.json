    "intro": "Dicranopteris pedalis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and rice fields. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Dicranopteris pedalis plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
