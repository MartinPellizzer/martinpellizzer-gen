    "intro": "Dendrobium banghamii, commonly known as the Bangham's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
