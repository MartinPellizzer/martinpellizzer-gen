    "intro": "Dombeya rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
