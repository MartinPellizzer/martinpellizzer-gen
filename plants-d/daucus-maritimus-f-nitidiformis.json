It is characterized by its finely toothed, smooth-textured leaves and its striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is well adapted to saline environments and can tolerate strong winds and salt spray. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable component of coastal flora."
