    "intro": "Dryopteris equestris var. mentiens, commonly known as the Mentz's wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a perennial fern characterized by its stout, upright rhizomes and compound fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
