    "intro": "Dendrochilum gracile, commonly known as the slender tree orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrochilum gracile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
