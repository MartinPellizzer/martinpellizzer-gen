    "intro": "Dalbergia campenonii, commonly known as the Cambodja rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The wood of this species is highly valued for its fine grain and rich color, making it a prized material in traditional craftsmanship. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
