    "intro": "Diarthron issykkulense, commonly known as the Issykkulense clubmoss, is a rare vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a sporophyte that develops from the gametophyte. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
