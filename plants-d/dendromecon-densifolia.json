    "intro": "Dendromecon densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Dendromecon densifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal environments with mild, temperate climates."
