    "intro": "Draco surculosa, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique succulent native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it bears yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its most notable feature is the production of a red, resinous sap, which has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. The species is also known for its slow growth and ability to survive in poor soil conditions."
