It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and heathlands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a rhizome that produces a single leaf and a flower spike. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple or brown lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is listed as endangered in the UK due to habitat loss and is protected under conservation laws."
