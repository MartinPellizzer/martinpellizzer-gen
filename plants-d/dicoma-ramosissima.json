    "intro": "Dicoma ramosissima, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dicoma ramosissima is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique texture and resilience."
