    "intro": "Dianthus costae subsp. algetanus, commonly known as the Algetan campion, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate and a compact, low-growing habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
