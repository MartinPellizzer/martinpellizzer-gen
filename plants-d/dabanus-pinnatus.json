    "intro": "Dabanus pinnatus, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Dabanus pinnatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
