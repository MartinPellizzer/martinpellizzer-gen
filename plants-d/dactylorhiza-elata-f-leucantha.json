    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and requires consistently moist conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
