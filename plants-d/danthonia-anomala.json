It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering heads are small and clustered, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Danthonia anomala plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
