It is characterized by its upright, clustered growth habit and distinctive fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge. The plant features bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.
