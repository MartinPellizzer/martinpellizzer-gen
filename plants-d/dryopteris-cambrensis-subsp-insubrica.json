    "intro": "Dryopteris cambrensis subsp. insubrica, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a fern native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native ecosystems."
