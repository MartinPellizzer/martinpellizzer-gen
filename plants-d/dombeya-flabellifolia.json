It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates. Dombeya flabellifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
