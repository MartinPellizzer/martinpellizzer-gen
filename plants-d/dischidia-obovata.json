It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded areas within forests. Dischidia obovata is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ornamental foliage."
