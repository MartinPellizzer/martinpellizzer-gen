    "intro": "Dendrobium palmifolium, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height. Its leaves are broad and palm-like, giving it its common name. It is known for its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, and pink."
