    "intro": "Dioscorea chagllaensis, commonly known as the Andean yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. This perennial vine produces tuberous roots that are often used as a food source by indigenous communities. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, adapting to the harsh, cool climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. The tubers of D. chagllaensis are rich in starch and have been traditionally cultivated for both nutritional and medicinal purposes."
