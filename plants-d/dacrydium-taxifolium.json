    "intro": "Dacrydium taxifolium, commonly known as the silver pine, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically silver-blue in color, giving the plant its common name. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years. It thrives in temperate rainforest environments and is adapted to moist, cool climates. The species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, with some individuals living over 500 years."
