    "intro": "Dorstenia carnosula, commonly known as the fat-leafed cat's tail, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its growth habit is typically upright, with stems that can become woody over time. Dorstenia carnosula is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens."
