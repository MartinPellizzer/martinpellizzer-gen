The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous on the upper surface. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Dendrocalamus nudus is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it an important species in bamboo ecosystems."
