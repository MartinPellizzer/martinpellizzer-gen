It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or pale brown. Dicliptera nasikensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
