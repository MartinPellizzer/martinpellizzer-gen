    "intro": "Dendrobium pogoniates, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its long-lasting, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates with high light exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
