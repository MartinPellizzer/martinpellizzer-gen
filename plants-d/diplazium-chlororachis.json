    "intro": "Diplazium chlororachis, commonly known as the green-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often dark green with prominent, pale veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, aiding in its spread. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
