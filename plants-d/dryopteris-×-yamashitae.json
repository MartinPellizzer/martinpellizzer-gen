    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 yamashitae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris erythrosora and Dryopteris japonica. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern Asia. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscape design."
