    "intro": "Diperis, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are found in grassland and savanna habitats. The plants typically have basal leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. Diperis species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions. They are also valued for their role in supporting local pollinator populations."
