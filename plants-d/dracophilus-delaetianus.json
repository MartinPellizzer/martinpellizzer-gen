    "intro": "Dracophilus delaetianus, commonly known as the Delaetian dragon's breath, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to vibrant orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a short, stocky stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
