    "intro": "Drypetes forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' drypetes, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
