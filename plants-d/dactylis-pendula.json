    "intro": "Dactylis pendula, commonly known as the hanging grass or pendulous grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a perennial species belonging to the grass family Poaceae, characterized by its drooping inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Dactylis pendula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
