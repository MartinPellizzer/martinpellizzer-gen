    "intro": "Dendrobium camptocentrum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium camptocentrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
