It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often colorful floral structures adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
