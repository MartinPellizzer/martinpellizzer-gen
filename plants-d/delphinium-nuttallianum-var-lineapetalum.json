    "intro": "Delphinium nuttallianum var. lineapetalum, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the western United States. It features tall, spiky inflorescences with showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children."
