    "intro": "Dasylirion recurvatum, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, cylindrical, gray-green leaves that are narrow and recurved, giving it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for arid climates and xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
