    "intro": "Digitaria fulva, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other native grasses in restoration projects. Digitaria fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological landscapes."
