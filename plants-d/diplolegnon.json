    "intro": "Diplolegnon, commonly known as the common stinkhorn, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Phallaceae. These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, often foul-smelling caps that attract flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting bodies typically develop from a basal, egg-like structure called a volva. They are commonly found in decaying organic matter, especially in moist, shaded environments. Diplolegnon species play a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
