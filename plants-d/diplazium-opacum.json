    "intro": "Diplazium opacum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-colored hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium opacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
