    "intro": "Dendrobium nagataksaka, commonly known as the Nagataksaka orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thin layer of white tomentum. It prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
