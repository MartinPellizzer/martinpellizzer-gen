    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum, commonly known as the orchid with the golden spike, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive golden spike. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium speciosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
