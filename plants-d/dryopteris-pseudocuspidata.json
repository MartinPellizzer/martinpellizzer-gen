    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudocuspidata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
