    "intro": "Deyeuxia forsteri var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth-haired false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are somewhat smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Deyeuxia genus."
