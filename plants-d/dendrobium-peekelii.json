It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base of the stem. Dendrobium peekelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
