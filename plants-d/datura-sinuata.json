    "intro": "Datura sinuata, commonly known as the fringed datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, opening at night and emitting a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its fruits are spiny capsules that split open to release seeds, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals."
