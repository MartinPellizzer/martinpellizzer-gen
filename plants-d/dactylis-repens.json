    "intro": "Dactylis repens, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Dactylis repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been traditionally used in floral arrangements and as a source of fiber."
