It is characterized by its upright, slender fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and streamside habitats. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
