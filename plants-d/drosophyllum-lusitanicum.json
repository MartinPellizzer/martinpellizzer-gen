    "intro": "Drosophyllum lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Portugal and northern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's secreted enzymes. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and requires ample sunlight. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in summer. Drosophyllum lusitanicum is adapted to arid environments and can enter a dormant state during dry periods."
