    "intro": "Derris mollis, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright orange or yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Derris mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
