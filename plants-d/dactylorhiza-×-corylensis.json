    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 corylensis, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near waterlogged soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms with striking yellow or orange flowers that have a distinctive spurred shape. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
