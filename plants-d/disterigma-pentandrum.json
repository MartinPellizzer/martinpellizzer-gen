    "intro": "Disterigma pentandrum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple in color. It produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of its family. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and agricultural settings."
