    "intro": "Deparia pycnosora, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and dark green coloration."
