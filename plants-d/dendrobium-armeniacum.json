    "intro": "Dendrobium armeniacum, commonly known as the Armenian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, often brightly colored blooms that range from white to pink and yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil in its native habitat. Dendrobium armeniacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
