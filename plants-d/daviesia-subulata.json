It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in heathlands and open woodlands. Daviesia subulata is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
