It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive sickle-shaped appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, narrow clusters, followed by oblong, seed-containing pods. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Desmodium trichostachyum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
