    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata var. dalarnensis, commonly known as the Dalarna orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Scandinavia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy spike of pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its flowers have a distinctive dark purple or brown blotch at the base of the petals, which is a key identifying feature. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as critically endangered in many regions."
