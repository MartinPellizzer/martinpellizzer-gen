    "intro": "Davallia venusta, commonly known as the silver-veined hartiara, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with silvery veins that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize new areas. Davallia venusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
