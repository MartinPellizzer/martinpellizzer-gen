    "intro": "Delphinium tangkulaense, commonly known as the Tangkula bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spires of flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
