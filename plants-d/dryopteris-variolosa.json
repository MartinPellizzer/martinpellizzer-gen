    "intro": "Dryopteris variolosa, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
