    "intro": "Danthonia purpurea var. setosa, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 30 inches tall, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, wet meadows, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
