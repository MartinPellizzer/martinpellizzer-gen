    "intro": "Dalea conetensis, commonly known as the prairie milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has small, compound leaves with stipules, and its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Dalea conetensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
