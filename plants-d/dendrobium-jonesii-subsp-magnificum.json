    "intro": "Dendrobium jonesii subsp. magnificum, commonly known as the magnificent dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining potting media."
