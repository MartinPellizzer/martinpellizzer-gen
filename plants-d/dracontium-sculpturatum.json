    "intro": "Dracontium sculpturatum, commonly known as the sculptured arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with intricate, sculpted patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces striking purple spatheae that enclose its small, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its unique leaf morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collectors. However, it is important to note that it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
