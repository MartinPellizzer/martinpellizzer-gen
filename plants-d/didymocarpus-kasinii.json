    "intro": "Didymocarpus kasinii, commonly known as the Khasi sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
