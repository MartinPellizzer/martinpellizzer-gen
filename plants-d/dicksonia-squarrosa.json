    "intro": "Dicksonia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance at the tips. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small animals and insects."
