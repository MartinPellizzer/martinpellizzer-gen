    "intro": "Dracaena knerkiana, commonly known as the red-veined dracaena, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that have a vibrant green color with prominent red veins. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dracaena knerkiana is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
