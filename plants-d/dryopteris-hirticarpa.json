    "intro": "Dryopteris hirticarpa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile fronds producing spores on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
