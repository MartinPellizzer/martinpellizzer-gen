    "intro": "Dendrobium juncoideum, commonly known as the silver stripe dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. Dendrobium juncoideum produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
