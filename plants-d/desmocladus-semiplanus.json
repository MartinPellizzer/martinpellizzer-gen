    "intro": "Desmocladus semiplanus, commonly known as the flatleaf desmocladus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its low-growing form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
