    "intro": "Dryopteris subglandulosa, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The broad buckler fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
