    "intro": "Danthonia gracilis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
