    "intro": "Devendraea alberti, commonly known as the Albert's devendraea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its inflorescence bears a single, elongated spike with several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
