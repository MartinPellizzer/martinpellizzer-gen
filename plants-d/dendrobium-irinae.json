    "intro": "Dendrobium irinae, commonly known as the Irinae orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-white, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium irinae is considered a threatened species."
