    "intro": "Drynaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Drynaria rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
