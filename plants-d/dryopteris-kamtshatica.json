    "intro": "Dryopteris kamtshatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
