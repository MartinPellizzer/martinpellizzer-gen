It typically thrives in rocky, alpine, or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a dense rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
