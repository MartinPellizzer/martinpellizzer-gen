    "intro": "Dryopteris falciculata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are dark green and have a slightly serrated margin, with a distinctive, narrow shape that sets it apart from other ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
