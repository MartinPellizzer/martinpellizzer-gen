    "intro": "Diplazium pseudocrinipes, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori. Diplazium pseudocrinipes thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with a preference for well-drained, humus-rich soil."
