It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
