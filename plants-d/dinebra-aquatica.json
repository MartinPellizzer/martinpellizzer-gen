    "intro": "Dinebra aquatica, commonly known as water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Dinebra aquatica is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both submerged and emergent conditions."
