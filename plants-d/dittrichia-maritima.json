    "intro": "Dittrichia maritima, commonly known as sea dittany, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in coastal environments, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sea dittany is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
