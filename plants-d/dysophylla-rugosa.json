    "intro": "Dysophylla rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dysophylla, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Dysophylla rugosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
