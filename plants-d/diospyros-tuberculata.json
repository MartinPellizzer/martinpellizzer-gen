    "intro": "Diospyros tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-shelled ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round fruits with a leathery, rough texture. Its fruits are typically edible, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use. The species is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture making."
