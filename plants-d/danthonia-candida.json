    "intro": "Danthonia candida, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in dense clusters, which are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Danthonia candida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant gardens."
