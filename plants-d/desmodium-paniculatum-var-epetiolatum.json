It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets that are often clustered closely together. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called panicles. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in various soil types. It is often found in disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
