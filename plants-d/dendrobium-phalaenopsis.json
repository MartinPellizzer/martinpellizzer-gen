    "intro": "Dendrobium phalaenopsis, commonly known as the orchid butterfly, is a type of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, long-lasting flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically blooms once a year, producing fragrant, velvety petals in shades of white, pink, and yellow. It prefers bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Dendrobium phalaenopsis is popular as a houseplant due to its elegance and relatively easy care requirements."
