    "intro": "Dentillaria zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark brown, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat."
