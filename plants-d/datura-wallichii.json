    "intro": "Datura wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Datura wallichii belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations."
