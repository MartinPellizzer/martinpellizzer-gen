It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of pale yellow to golden flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety is distinguished by its yellowish-green coloration, which gives it its common name."
