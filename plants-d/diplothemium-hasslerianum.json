    "intro": "Diplothemium hasslerianum, commonly known as the Hassler's diplothemium, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Central America and is adapted to moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
