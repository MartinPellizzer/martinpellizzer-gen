    "intro": "Dombeya tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that covers its entire surface. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dombeya tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to well-drained, sunny gardens."
