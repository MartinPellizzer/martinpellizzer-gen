    "intro": "Daucus communis subsp. maximus, commonly known as the giant wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to the common carrot but are less commonly cultivated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
