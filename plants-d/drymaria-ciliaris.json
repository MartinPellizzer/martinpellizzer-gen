    "intro": "Drymaria ciliaris, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Drymaria ciliaris is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
