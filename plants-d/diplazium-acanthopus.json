    "intro": "Diplazium acanthopus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are divided into segments with a shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name."
