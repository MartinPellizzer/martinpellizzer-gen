    "intro": "Dianthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Dianthus prostratus is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
