    "intro": "Dracophyllum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to wetland and coastal habitats in southeastern Australia. It features dense, leathery foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Dracophyllum paludosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
