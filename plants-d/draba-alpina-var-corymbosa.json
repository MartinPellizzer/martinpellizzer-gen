    "intro": "Draba alpina var. corymbosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems. The variety corymbosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser flowering clusters compared to the typical form."
