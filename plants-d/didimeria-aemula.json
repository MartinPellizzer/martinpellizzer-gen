    "intro": "Didimeria aemula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
