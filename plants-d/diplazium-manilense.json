    "intro": "Diplazium manilense, commonly known as the Manila brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of fronds: sterile and fertile. The sterile fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a rough texture, while the fertile fronds bear spore-bearing structures called sori. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes."
