    "intro": "Dendrobium fuliginosum, commonly known as the smoky orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium fuliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
