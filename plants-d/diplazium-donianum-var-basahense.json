    "intro": "Diplazium donianum var. basahense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, thin fronds that float on the water surface, with sporangia developing on the underside of the leaves. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas."
