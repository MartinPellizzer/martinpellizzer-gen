    "intro": "Delphinium taliense var. hirsutum, commonly known as the Hirsute Larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy, giving it its varietal name \"hirsutum,\" which means hairy in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
