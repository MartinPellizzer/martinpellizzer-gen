    "intro": "Dendrochilum bicallosum, commonly known as the Bicallo's tree orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and long, linear leaves that help it cling to tree branches. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic plants. Dendrochilum bicallosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native forest habitats."
