    "intro": "Dryopteris aequibasis, commonly known as the broad-crested woodfern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from clusters of sori located on the underside of the fronds. The broad-crested woodfern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
