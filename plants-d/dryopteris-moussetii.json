    "intro": "Dryopteris moussetii, commonly known as the Mousset's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, bipinnate leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
