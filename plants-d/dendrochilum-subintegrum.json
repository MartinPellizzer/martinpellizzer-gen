    "intro": "Dendrochilum subintegrum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of its epiphytic and terrestrial growth habits. The plant produces striking, velvety purple or violet flowers with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
