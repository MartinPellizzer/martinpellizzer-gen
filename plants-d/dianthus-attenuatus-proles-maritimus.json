    "intro": "Dianthus attenuatus proles maritimus, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, linear leaves and produces pink or red flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
