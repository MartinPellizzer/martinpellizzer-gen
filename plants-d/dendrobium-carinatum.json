    "intro": "Dendrobium carinatum, commonly known as the ridge-lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive ridge on the lip. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged spirally around the stem. Dendrobium carinatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
