    "intro": "Diphyes aberrans, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Diphyes aberrans plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
