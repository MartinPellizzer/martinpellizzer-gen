    "intro": "Dortmanna ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Dortmanna ehrenbergii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
