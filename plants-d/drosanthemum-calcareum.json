    "intro": "Drosanthemum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone daisies, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its unique adaptations to arid environments. It is native to southern Africa, particularly regions with limestone soils, which influence its growth habits and nutrient uptake. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in coastal and inland areas with high salinity and alkaline conditions."
