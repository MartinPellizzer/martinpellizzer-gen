    "intro": "Dubautia syndetica, commonly known as the Kona ironwood, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Dubautia syndetica is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal areas and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
