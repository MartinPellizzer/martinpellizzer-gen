    "intro": "Dryopteris oligodonta, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
