    "intro": "Dyckia incana, commonly known as the woolly dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a compact rosette, with long, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color. It produces inflorescences of white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Dyckia incana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
