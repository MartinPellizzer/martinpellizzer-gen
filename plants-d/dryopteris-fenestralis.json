    "intro": "Dryopteris fenestralis, commonly known as the fenestrated wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of rounded, fenestrated (window-like) gaps along the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time."
