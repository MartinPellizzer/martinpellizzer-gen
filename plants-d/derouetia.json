These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and thick, fleshy leaves. Derouetia species typically have a short, stocky stem with a rosette of leaves that store water, aiding in their survival in arid conditions. The flowers are usually clustered in a terminal inflorescence and come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their beauty and ease of care."
