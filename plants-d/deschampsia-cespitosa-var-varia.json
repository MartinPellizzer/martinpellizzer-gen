It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and the flowers are wind-pollinated. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
