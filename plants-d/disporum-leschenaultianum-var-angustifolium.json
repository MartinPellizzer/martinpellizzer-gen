    "intro": "Disporum leschenaultianum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf threadleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a bluish-green hue. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, adding delicate beauty to its foliage. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
