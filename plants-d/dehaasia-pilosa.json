    "intro": "Dehaasia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy dehaasia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dehaasia pilosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
