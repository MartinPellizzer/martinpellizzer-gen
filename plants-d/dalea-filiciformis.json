    "intro": "Dalea filiciformis, commonly known as the featherleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Dalea filiciformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
