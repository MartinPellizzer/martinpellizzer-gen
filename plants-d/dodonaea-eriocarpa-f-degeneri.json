    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa f. degeneri, commonly known as the Degener's Dodonaea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
