    "intro": "Draba surculosa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Draba surculosa is often found in meadows, gravelly slopes, and scree areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
