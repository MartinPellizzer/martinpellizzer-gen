    "intro": "Dichrotrichum minus, commonly known as the small hairy grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring or early summer, which are arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, Dichrotrichum minus is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
