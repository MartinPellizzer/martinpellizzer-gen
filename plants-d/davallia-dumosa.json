    "intro": "Davallia dumosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy tissue, which gives it its common name. Davallia dumosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
