    "intro": "Davallia divaricata, commonly known as the hairy-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Davallia divaricata is a popular ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
