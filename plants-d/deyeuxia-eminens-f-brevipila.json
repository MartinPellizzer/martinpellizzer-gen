    "intro": "Deyeuxia eminens f. brevipila, commonly known as the short-branched tussock grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense tussocks, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of many grass species. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the vegetation structure. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
