    "intro": "Dryandra erythrocephala, commonly known as the red-headed dryandra, is a striking shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which includes many flowering plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking, fiery red flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. The species is notable for its ecological importance, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
