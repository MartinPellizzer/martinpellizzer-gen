    "intro": "Diospyros pilosa, commonly known as the hairy persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, orange-red fruits. The fruits are typically edible when fully ripe, though they may have a bitter taste when unripe. Diospyros pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
