    "intro": "Dalbergia ecastaphyllum, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing flattened, seed-like structures. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is also cultivated in horticultural settings."
