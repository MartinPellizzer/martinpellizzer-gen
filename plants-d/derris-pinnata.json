    "intro": "Derris pinnata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with long, slender leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
