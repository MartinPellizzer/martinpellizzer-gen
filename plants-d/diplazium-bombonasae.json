    "intro": "Diplazium bombonasae, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, while its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success in its natural habitat."
