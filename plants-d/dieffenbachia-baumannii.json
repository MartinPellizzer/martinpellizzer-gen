    "intro": "Dieffenbachia baumannii, commonly known as the \"shooting star\" plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, or cream patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant but can be toxic if ingested by humans or animals."
