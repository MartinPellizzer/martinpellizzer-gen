    "intro": "Dendrobium terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) characterized by its ability to grow on the ground rather than on trees. It is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, adapting to its terrestrial lifestyle. Dendrobium terrestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions."
