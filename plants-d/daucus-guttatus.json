    "intro": "Daucus guttatus, commonly known as the purple carrot, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, purple to pink flowers. Its roots are typically thin and not as robust as those of the domesticated carrot. Daucus guttatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
