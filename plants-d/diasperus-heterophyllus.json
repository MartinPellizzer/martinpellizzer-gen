    "intro": "Diasperus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its branching stems that are typically covered in spines and are often green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are usually small and may vary in shape, contributing to its common name. Diasperus heterophyllus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
