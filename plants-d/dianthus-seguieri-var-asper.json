    "intro": "Dianthus seguieri var. asper, commonly known as the rough pinks or rock pinks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive frilled appearance. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. The flowers bloom in spring and early summer, adding vibrant color to alpine and coastal environments."
