    "intro": "Dalea zuccarinii, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that mature in the fall. Dalea zuccarinii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
