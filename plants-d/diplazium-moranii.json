    "intro": "Diplazium moranii, commonly known as the Moran's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has long, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a feathery appearance. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Diplazium moranii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
