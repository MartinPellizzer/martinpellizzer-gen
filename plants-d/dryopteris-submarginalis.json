    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, dense foliage."
