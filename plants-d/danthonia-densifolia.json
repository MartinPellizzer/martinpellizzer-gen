    "intro": "Danthonia densifolia, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and wind. Danthonia densifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
