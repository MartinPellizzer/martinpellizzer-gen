    "intro": "Desmochaeta xanthioides, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Desmochaeta xanthioides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
