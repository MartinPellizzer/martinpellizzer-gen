    "intro": "Dendrobium xiphiphorum, commonly known as the golden dragon orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive pattern of darker markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
