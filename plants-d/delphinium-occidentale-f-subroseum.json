    "intro": "Delphinium occidentale f. subroseum, commonly known as the western larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The subspecies subroseum is distinguished by its pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which are slightly smaller than those of the typical form. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
