    "intro": "Dennstaedtia incurvata, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that curl tightly when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. The curled fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture."
