    "intro": "Dryopteris riedleana, commonly known as the Riedel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in the reproductive cycle of ferns."
