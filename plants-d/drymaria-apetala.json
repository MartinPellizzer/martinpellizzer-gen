    "intro": "Drymaria apetala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that appear in clusters, often giving it a spectral appearance. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Drymaria apetala is often found in disturbed soils and is a common species in desert and grassland habitats."
