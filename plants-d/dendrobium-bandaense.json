    "intro": "Dendrobium bandaense, commonly known as the Banda Island orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Dendrobium bandaense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
