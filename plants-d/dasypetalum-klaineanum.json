    "intro": "Dasypetalum klaineanum, commonly known as the Kleana ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to glow in low light conditions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden within its dense foliage. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
