    "intro": "Digitaria leiantha, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Digitaria leiantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
