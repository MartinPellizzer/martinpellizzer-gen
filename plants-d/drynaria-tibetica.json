    "intro": "Drynaria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cliff fern, is a perennial fern species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, including regions in Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces sterile fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
