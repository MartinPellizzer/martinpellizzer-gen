    "intro": "Demorchis confusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, containing cardiac glycosides. Demorchis confusa plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
