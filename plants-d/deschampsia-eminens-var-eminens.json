    "intro": "Deschampsia eminens var. eminens, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that becomes bluish-gray in color during the summer. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
