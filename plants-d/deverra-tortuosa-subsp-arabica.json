    "intro": "Deverra tortuosa subsp. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and semi-desert environments, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
