    "intro": "Datura fastuosa var. dubia, commonly known as the desert angel's trumpet, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a faint purple or pinkish hue. The plant produces smooth, ribbed stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Datura fastuosa var. dubia is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
