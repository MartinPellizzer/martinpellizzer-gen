    "intro": "Dryopteris fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The Fournier's wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
