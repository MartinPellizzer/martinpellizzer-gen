    "intro": "Declieuxia cacuminis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved declieuxia, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats."
