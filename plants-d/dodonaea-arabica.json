    "intro": "Dodonaea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian Dodonaea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, resinous bark that provides some resistance to drought and pests. Dodonaea arabica is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
