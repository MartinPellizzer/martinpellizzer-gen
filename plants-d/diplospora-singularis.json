    "intro": "Diplospora singularis, commonly known as the singular spore fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structure, which features a single spore-producing organ, distinguishing it from most other ferns. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a short rhizome and a single, delicate frond that emerges from the base. Its spores are typically produced in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is located at the base of the frond. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Diplospora singularis is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
