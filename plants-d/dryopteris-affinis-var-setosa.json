    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The hairy appearance of the fronds is a key identifying characteristic of this variety."
