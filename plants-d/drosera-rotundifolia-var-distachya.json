    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. distachya, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves covered in sticky glands that trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heaths. Its ability to digest insects allows it to obtain essential nutrients in its otherwise barren habitat."
