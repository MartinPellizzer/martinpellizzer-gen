It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, branched fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.
