    "intro": "Dischidia lagenifera, commonly known as the bottle-shaped fig. It is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its unique, swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Dischidia lagenifera is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
