The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
