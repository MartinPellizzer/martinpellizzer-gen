It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are leathery and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry environments. Dracophyllum desgrazii is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
