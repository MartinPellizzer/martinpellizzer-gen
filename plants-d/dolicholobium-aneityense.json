It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes characterized by their pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, elongated pods, which contribute to its scientific name \"dolicholobium,\" meaning \"long pod.\" This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
