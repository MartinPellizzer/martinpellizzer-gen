It features a stout, ridged stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are edible when cooked.
