It is a tropical fern native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are long and linear, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The varietal name 'ferruginea' refers to the reddish-brown coloration of its sporangia, which is a key identifying feature."
