    "intro": "Doratoxylon apetalum var. diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved doratoxylon, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant exhibits a distinct varietal form, with diphyllum referring to its two-leaf structure, which is a notable morphological feature. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like arrangements. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to researchers studying plant diversity in arid environments."
