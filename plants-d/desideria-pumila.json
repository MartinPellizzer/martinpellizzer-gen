    "intro": "Desideria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
