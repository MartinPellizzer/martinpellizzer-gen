    "intro": "Dryopteris standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a feathery, delicate appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in shaded, humid habitats."
