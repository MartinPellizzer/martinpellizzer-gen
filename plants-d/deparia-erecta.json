    "intro": "Deparia erecta, commonly known as the upright water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender fronds that grow directly from the rhizome, often forming dense clusters in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant typically thrives in muddy or sandy substrates and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and the margins of streams. Its leaves are usually pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the frond. Deparia erecta plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
