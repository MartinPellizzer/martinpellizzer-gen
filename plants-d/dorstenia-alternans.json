    "intro": "Dorstenia alternans, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the family Malvaceae and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems and heart-shaped leaves that alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal. Dorstenia alternans is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying properties."
