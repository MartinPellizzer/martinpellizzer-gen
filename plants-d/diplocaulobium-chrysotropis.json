It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soils and partial shade."
