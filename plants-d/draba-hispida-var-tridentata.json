    "intro": "Draba hispida var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed whitlow grass, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, toothed margin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. This species is part of the Brassicaceae family, known for its mustard-like flowers and ecological importance in stabilizing barren landscapes."
