It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with only reduced leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its unique morphology and vibrant blooms make it an interesting addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
