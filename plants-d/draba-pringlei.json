    "intro": "Draba pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba pringlei is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers."
