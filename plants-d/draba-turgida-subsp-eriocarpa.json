    "intro": "Draba turgida subsp. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the presence of the dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the species."
