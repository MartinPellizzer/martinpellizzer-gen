    "intro": "Draba oligosperma var. sphaeroides, commonly known as the spherical rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in tight, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered a characteristic species of high-altitude flora."
