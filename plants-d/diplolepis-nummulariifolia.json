    "intro": "Diplolepis nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves that are oval-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
