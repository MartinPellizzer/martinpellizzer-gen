    "intro": "Dryopteris sorbifolia f. genuina, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and stout, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it in rich, organic soil. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
