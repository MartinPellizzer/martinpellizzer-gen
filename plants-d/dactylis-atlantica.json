    "intro": "Dactylis atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Dactylis atlantica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
