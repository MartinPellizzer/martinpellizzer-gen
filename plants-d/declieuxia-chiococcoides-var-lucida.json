    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides var. lucida, commonly known as the shining leathery fern, is a unique plant characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in shaded gardens."
