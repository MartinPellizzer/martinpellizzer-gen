    "intro": "Delphinium hybridum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
