    "intro": "Dicrocaulon trichotomum, commonly known as the three-branched bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its carnivorous habits, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey."
