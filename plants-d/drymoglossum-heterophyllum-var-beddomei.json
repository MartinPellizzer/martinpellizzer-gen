    "intro": "Drymoglossum heterophyllum var. beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and elongated, narrow leaves that are often recurved at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stems called setae. This variety is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Drymoglossum heterophyllum."
