    "intro": "Draba hirta var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or white, appearing in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its soft, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its survival in harsh alpine conditions."
