It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, often reddish leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
