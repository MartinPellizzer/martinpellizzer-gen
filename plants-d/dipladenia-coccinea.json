    "intro": "Dipladenia coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a vigorous climber with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red and orange. The plant blooms throughout the growing season, typically from spring to fall, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, making it a popular choice for trellises and garden borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
