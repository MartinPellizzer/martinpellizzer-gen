    "intro": "Doodia kunthiana, commonly known as the golden fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Doodia kunthiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique coloration and structure make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
