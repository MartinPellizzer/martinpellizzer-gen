    "intro": "Dortmanna griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments. Dortmanna griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
