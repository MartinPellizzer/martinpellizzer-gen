    "intro": "Dubautia \u00d7 mendacoides, commonly known as the hybridhoa or hybrid Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dubautia hawaiiensis and Dubautia menziesii, two native Hawaiian species. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its natural range is limited to specific areas of Hawaii."
