It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
