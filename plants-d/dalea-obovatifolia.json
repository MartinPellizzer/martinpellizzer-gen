    "intro": "Dalea obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow or white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry pods that contain its seeds. Dalea obovatifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
