    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia capitata var. emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and a dense cluster of grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
