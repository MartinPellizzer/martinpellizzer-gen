It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and rugged, often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its hard timber and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
