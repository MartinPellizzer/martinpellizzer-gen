    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed couch grass, is a variant of the common couch grass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich environments. This form is valued for its use in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
