It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, orange-red fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Its fruit is an important food source for both wildlife and humans in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional crafts and construction."
