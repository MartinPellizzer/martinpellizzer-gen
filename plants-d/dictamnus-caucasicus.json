It is a perennial herb with aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
