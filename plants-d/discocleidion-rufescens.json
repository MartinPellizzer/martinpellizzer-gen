It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, reddish-barked trunks that become fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, often with a leathery texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental bark and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
