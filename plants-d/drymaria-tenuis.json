    "intro": "Drymaria tenuis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Drymaria tenuis is often found in disturbed areas, sandy soils, and along roadsides, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats."
