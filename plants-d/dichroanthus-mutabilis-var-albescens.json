    "intro": "Dichroanthus mutabilis var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to white ray florets that contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, clustered disk flowers that develop into fluffy, pale brown seeds. This variant is distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to other varieties of Dichroanthus mutabilis."
