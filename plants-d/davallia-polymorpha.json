    "intro": "Davallia polymorpha, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia polymorpha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive indoors."
