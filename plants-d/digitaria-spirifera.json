    "intro": "Digitaria spirifera, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
