    "intro": "Dracaena guilfoylei, commonly known as the Kauri Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for native birds. Dracaena guilfoylei thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a cool, humid climate, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to New Zealand's native flora."
