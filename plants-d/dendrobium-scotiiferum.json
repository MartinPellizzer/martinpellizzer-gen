    "intro": "Dendrobium scotiiferum, commonly known as the Scottish orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in peat bogs or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Dendrobium scotiiferum is a rare and protected species, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological significance."
