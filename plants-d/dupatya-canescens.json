    "intro": "Dupatya canescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The botanical features of Dupatya canescens make it a unique and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
