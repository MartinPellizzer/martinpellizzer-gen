    "intro": "Dorstenia umbricola, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems and its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of green and yellow, and it is known for its slow growth and rarity in cultivation. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Dorstenia umbricola is considered a challenging plant to grow outside its native habitat."
