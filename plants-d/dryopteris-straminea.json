    "intro": "Dryopteris straminea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are adorned with a cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
