    "intro": "Dendrotrophe palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane rainforests. Its rhizome system helps anchor it to the forest floor, while its fronds contribute to the canopy layer of the ecosystem. Dendrotrophe palawanensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
