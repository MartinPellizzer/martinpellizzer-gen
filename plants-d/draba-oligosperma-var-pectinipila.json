    "intro": "Draba oligosperma var. pectinipila, commonly known as the Sierra draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Draba oligosperma var. pectinipila is an important component of high-elevation plant communities and is often found in meadows and open slopes."
