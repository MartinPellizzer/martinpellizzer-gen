    "intro": "Dendrobium ou-hinnae, commonly known as the Ouhinnan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with clustered leaves. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
