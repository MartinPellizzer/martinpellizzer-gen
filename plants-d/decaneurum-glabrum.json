    "intro": "Decaneurum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Decaneurum glabrum is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
