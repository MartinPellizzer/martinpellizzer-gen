    "intro": "Dryopteris oochlamys, commonly known as the broadleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
