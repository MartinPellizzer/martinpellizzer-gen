    "intro": "Derris pyrrothyrsa, commonly known as the African spurge, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
