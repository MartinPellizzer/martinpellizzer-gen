    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens var. lanyuense, commonly known as Lanyu holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
