    "intro": "Dendrobium violaceoflavens, commonly known as the violet-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
