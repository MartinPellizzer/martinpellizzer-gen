    "intro": "Dryopteris noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
