    "intro": "Dendrobium whistleri, commonly known as the Whistler's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its climbing lifestyle. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
