    "intro": "Dyckia viridicentra, commonly known as the green-centred dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive yellow or white midrib. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia viridicentra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
