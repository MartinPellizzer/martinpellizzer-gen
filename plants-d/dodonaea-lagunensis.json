    "intro": "Dodonaea lagunensis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Dodonaea lagunensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
