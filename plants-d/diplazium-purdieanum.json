    "intro": "Diplazium purdieanum, commonly known as the New Zealand hard fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Diplazium purdieanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
