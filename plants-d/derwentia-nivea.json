    "intro": "Derwentia nivea, commonly known as the white fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that are covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, damp areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, Derwentia nivea is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
