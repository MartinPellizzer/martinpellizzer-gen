    "intro": "Dillenia speciosa, commonly known as the showy dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five to seven petals, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Dillenia speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
