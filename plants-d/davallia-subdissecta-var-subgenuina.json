    "intro": "Davallia subdissecta var. subgenuina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, hairy structures on its leaves. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form a dense network, allowing it to cling to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage is evergreen, with a unique appearance that resembles a cluster of tiny, feather-like leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
