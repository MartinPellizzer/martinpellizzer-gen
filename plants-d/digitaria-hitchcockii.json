    "intro": "Digitaria hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's Digitaria, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Hitchcock's Digitaria is generally drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments."
