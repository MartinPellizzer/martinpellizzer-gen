    "intro": "Dendrocnide meyeniana f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth stinging tree, is a variant of the stinging tree species native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairless structures that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical rainforest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas."
