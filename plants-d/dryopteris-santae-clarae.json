    "intro": "Dryopteris santae-clarae, commonly known as Santa Clara fern, is a species of wood fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators."
