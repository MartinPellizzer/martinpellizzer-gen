    "intro": "Davallia blumei, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with adventitious roots that anchor it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to 1 meter in length. Davallia blumei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
