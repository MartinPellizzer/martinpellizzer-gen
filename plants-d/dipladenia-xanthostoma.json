    "intro": "Dipladenia xanthostoma, commonly known as the yellow dipladenia, is a vigorous trailing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dipladenia xanthostoma is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its rapid growth and showy appearance."
