    "intro": "Duranta dickinsonii, commonly known as the red duranta, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, which later develop into bright blue or purple berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The berries are edible for birds and small mammals, making it an important plant in local ecosystems."
