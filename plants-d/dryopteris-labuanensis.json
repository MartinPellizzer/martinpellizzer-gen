    "intro": "Dryopteris labuanensis, commonly known as the Labuan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a complex structure that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
