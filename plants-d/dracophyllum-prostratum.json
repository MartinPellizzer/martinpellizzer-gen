    "intro": "Dracophyllum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate dracophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in coastal and rocky environments, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its evergreen nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a hardy species. Dracophyllum prostratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and resilience."
