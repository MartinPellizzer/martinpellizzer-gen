    "intro": "Deverra rohlfsiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often fragrant, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical in shape. Deverra rohlfsiana is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
