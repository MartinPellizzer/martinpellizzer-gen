    "intro": "Dipladenia linearis, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display. Dipladenia linearis is also valued for its ability to climb trellises or other structures, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
