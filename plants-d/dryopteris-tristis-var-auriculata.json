    "intro": "Dryopteris tristis var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded forest floors. The plant features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the pinnae. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and conservation efforts."
