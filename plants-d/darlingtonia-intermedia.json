    "intro": "Darlingtonia intermedia, commonly known as the giant humped back pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form a pitfall trap to capture and digest insects. The plant produces a distinctive, hooded structure that channels prey into the digestive cavity. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires high humidity and cool temperatures. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
