    "intro": "Dendrobium speciosum var. nitidum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like pseudobulbs covered in dense, velvety foliage. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
