    "intro": "Deparia dolosa var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a variant of the water fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate and allowing it to colonize new areas. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
