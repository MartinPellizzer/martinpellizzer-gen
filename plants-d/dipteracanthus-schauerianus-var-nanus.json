It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated by botanists and gardeners interested in rare plant species."
