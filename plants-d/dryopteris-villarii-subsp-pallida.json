    "intro": "Dryopteris villarii subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in woodland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
