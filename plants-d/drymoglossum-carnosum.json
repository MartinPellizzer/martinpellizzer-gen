    "intro": "Drymoglossum carnosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically broad and overlapping, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This moss is often found in forest floors and rocky areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its simple structure and resilience make it an important component of many temperate ecosystems."
