    "intro": "Dryandra bipinnatifida subsp. multifida, commonly known as the Multifid Dryandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. The leaves are bipinnatifid, meaning they are divided into multiple narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats."
