    "intro": "Dialium pierrei, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its fine texture and durability. Dialium pierrei thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
