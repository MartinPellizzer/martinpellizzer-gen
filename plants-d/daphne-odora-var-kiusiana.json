It is characterized by its fragrant, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring protection from harsh winter winds. Due to its ornamental value and delicate fragrance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking winter color."
