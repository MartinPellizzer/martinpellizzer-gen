    "intro": "Desmodium foliosum, commonly known as the small-leaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Desmodium foliosum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
