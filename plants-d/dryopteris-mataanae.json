    "intro": "Dryopteris mataanae, commonly known as the Mataan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The Mataan fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
