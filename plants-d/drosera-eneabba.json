    "intro": "Drosera eneabba, commonly known as the Eneabba Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red. Drosera eneabba is a hardy species that can survive in low-nutrient conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
