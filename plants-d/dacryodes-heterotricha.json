It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
