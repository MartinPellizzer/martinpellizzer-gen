    "intro": "Dianthus juratensis, commonly known as the Juratense campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, and its stems are usually unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
