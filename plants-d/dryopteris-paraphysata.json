    "intro": "Dryopteris paraphysata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus."
