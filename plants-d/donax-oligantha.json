    "intro": "Donax oligantha, commonly known as the slender glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, where it helps stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various small organisms. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid or saline environments. Donax oligantha is often found in tidal marshes and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
