    "intro": "Disa welwitschii subsp. occultans, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a single, erect stem and a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
