    "intro": "Diplazium sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles water fern, is a species of fern native to the Seychelles archipelago. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted to aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, finger-like leaflets that help in maximizing light absorption. Diplazium sechellarum plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
