    "intro": "Daphniphyllum amamiense, commonly known as the Amami holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
