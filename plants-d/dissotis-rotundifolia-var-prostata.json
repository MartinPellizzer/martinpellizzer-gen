    "intro": "Dissotis rotundifolia var. prostata, commonly known as the prostrate roundleaf sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features dense, compact rosettes of dark green, round to oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers arranged in spike-like clusters during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wetland ecosystems and suitable for use in ornamental or ecological restoration projects."
