It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called corymbs. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
