    "intro": "Deutzia glabrata var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching branches with small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Smooth deutzia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact growth and seasonal floral display."
