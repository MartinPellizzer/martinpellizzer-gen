    "intro": "Dicranopteris sartorii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can absorb nutrients from the water. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself and spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its intricate, lace-like appearance."
