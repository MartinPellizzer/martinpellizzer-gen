    "intro": "Drymaria molluginea, commonly known as the cushion plant or marsh cushion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Its compact structure and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its often damp, cool habitats."
