    "intro": "Dicksonia scandens, commonly known as the climbing tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
