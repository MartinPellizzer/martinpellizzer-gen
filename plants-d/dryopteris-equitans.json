    "intro": "Dryopteris equitans, commonly known as the barren clubmoss, is a fern that belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris equitans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
