    "intro": "Daphne jezoensis, commonly known as the Japanese daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Daphne jezoensis is also noted for its winter hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
