    "intro": "Dendrocoryne speciosum, commonly known as the golden torch tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are primarily pollinated by insects, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
