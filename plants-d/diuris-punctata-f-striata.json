    "intro": "Diuris punctata f. striata, commonly known as the striped sun-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a compact, hairy stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often marked with distinct stripes. The plant produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns and a prominent central vein. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme and bloom during the autumn season. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced striping on the leaf and flower petals compared to the typical form of Diuris punctata."
