    "intro": "Diplacrum mitracarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its woody structure and drought-resistant features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat. Diplacrum mitracarpoides is often used in local landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
