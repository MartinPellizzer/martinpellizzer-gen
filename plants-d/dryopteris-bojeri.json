    "intro": "Dryopteris bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Dryopteris bojeri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its striking appearance."
