    "intro": "Dracaena ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's dragon tree, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest. Dracaena ghiesbreghtii is also noted for its ability to produce red sap, which is similar to that of other dracaena species."
