    "intro": "Dendrobium ruseae, commonly known as the Rusea's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium ruseae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
