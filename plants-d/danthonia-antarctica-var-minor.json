    "intro": "Danthonia antarctica var. minor, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of ecological studies in extreme climates."
