    "intro": "Dryopteris subincisa var. karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern. It is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often lobed shape. Its spores are produced in sori that are covered by indusia, a characteristic feature of many ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in shady garden settings."
