    "intro": "Dichanthelium ensifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like blades that are often sword-shaped, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often concealed among the foliage. Dichanthelium ensifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native environment."
