    "intro": "Daemonorops formicaria, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which reside in the specialized structures called domatia within its stems. The plant's foliage consists of large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
