    "intro": "Dendrobium macrum, commonly known as the Macrum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a branched stem that can reach up to several feet in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong fragrance, and bloom in clusters. Dendrobium macrum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
