It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, dark seeds. It is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
