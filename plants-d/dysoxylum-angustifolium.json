    "intro": "Dysoxylum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland rainforests."
