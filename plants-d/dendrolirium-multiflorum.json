    "intro": "Dendrolirium multiflorum, commonly known as the clustered lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem that bears a dense cluster of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. These flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dendrolirium multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
