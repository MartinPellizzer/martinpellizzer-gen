    "intro": "Diplazium oblongifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features compound leaves with oblong, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
