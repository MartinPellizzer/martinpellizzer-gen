    "intro": "Dendrobium schuitemanii, commonly known as the Schuiteman's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly threatened in the wild."
