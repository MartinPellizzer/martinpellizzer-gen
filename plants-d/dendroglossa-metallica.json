    "intro": "Dendroglossa metallica, commonly known as the metallic tree frog, is a species of tree frog found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive metallic green coloration, which helps it blend into its leafy surroundings. The plant-like appearance of the frog, with its elongated body and leaf-like skin, has led to its common name. It typically inhabits the canopy layers of dense forests, where it relies on camouflage for protection. Despite its name, the metallic tree frog is not a plant but a amphibian, showcasing the fascinating mimicry found in nature."
