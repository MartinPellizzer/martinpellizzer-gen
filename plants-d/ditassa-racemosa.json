    "intro": "Ditassa racemosa, commonly known as the African candle bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its woody stems are often covered in a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
