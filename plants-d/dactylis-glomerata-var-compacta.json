    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. compacta, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in pasture and erosion control due to its hardiness. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop and a resilient ornamental plant."
