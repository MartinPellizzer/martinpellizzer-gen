    "intro": "Danthonia racemosa, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Danthonia racemosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
