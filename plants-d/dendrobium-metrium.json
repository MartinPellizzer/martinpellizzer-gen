    "intro": "Dendrobium metrium, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Dendrobium metrium thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
