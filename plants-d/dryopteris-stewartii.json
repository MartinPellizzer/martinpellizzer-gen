    "intro": "Dryopteris stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
