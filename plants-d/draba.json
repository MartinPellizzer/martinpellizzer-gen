    "intro": "Draba, commonly known as whitlow grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous species that thrive in alpine and arctic regions. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, white or yellow flowers. Draba species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Many species are considered ornamental due to their compact growth and delicate flowers."
