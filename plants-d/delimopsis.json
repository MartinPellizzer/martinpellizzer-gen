    "intro": "Delimopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Delimopsis has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of white or pale green. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
