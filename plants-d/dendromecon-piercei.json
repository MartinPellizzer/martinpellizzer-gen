    "intro": "Dendromecon piercei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Dendromecon piercei is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
