    "intro": "Dortmanna capillifolia, commonly known as the slender hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in moist or shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Dortmanna capillifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
