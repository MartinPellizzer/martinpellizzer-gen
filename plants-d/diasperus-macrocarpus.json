It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or yellow in color. These fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit. Diasperus macrocarpus is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
