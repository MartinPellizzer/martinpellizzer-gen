    "intro": "Dryopteris aspidioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense, brownish layer of old spores. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Dryopteris aspidioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
