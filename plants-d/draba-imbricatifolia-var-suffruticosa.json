    "intro": "Draba imbricatifolia var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock draba, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a characteristic common among the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
