    "intro": "Drimia uitenhagensis, commonly known as the Uitenhage bulb, is a striking geophyte native to South Africa. It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its most notable characteristic is its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It blooms during the spring and summer months, typically in the Western Cape region. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
