    "intro": "Dendrophylax helorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale pink flowers. It is notable for its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
