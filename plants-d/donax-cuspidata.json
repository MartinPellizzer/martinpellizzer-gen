    "intro": "Donax cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh coastal conditions. Donax cuspidata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
