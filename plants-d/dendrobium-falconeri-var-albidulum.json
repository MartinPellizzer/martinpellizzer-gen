    "intro": "Dendrobium falconeri var. albidulum, commonly known as the white-flowered tree orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height, with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the dry season, typically from January to April. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ornamental qualities."
