    "intro": "Driessenia ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the cooler seasons. Driessenia ciliata is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
