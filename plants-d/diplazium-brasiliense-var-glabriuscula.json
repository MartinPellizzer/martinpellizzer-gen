    "intro": "Diplazium brasiliense var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to tropical regions. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant features fronds that are pinnately compound, with a generally smooth and glabrous surface. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. This variant is noted for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
