    "intro": "Deschampsia involucrata, commonly known as bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia involucrata is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
