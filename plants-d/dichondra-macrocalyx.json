    "intro": "Dichondra macrocalyx, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping in arid regions."
