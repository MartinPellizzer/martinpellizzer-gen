    "intro": "Danthonia longifolia, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, grass-like stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
