It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Didymoglossum alatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native environments."
