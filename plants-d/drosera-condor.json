    "intro": "Drosera condor, commonly known as the Condor Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hair covered leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing nectar to attract pollinators. Drosera condor is a hardy species that can survive in harsh conditions, making it a unique example of adaptive plant life in extreme climates."
