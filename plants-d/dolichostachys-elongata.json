    "intro": "Dolichostachys elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fibrous inflorescence that resembles a beard. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Dolichostachys elongata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
