    "intro": "Deschampsia elongata, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Deschampsia elongata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
