    "intro": "Dryopteris lijianxiui, commonly known as the Lijianxiu fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
