    "intro": "Dissomeria glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular dissomeria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It often grows in rocky or dry soils and is known for its subtle, spicy scent. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to contribute to its unique chemical profile and ecological interactions."
