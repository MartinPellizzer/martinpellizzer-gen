It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in umbels. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in forage and soil enrichment."
