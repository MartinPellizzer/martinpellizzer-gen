    "intro": "Dorvalia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, pale green leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Dorvalia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is highly valued in conservation efforts."
