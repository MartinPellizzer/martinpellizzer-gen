    "intro": "Dendrobium pandaneti, commonly known as the pandanet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium pandaneti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
