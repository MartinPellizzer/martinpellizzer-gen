    "intro": "Dryopteris tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and shade requirements."
