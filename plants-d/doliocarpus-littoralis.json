    "intro": "Doliocarpus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sycamore, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind and water, which is essential for its survival in coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones or near the shoreline. Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing coastal dunes and resisting salt spray."
