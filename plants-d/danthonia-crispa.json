    "intro": "Danthonia crispa, commonly known as the curly grass or crinkled grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely curled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, bearing small, spike-like inflorescences. Danthonia crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
