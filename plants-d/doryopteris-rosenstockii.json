It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. Doryopteris rosenstockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
