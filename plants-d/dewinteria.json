It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in spring. Dewinteria species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and hardy nature."
