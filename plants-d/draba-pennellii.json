    "intro": "Draba pennellii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Draba pennellii has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
