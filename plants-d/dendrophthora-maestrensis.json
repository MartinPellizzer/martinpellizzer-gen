    "intro": "Dendrophthora maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through its specialized haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Dendrophthora maestrensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting local wildlife."
