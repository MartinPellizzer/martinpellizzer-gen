    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia subsp. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine environments. It is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in well-drained soils in sunny or partially shaded areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous regions where it contributes to the local flora diversity."
