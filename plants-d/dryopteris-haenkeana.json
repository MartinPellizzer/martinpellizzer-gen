    "intro": "Dryopteris haenkeana, commonly known as the Haken's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
