    "intro": "Desmanthus leptolobus, commonly known as the slender-lobed burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. Its trifoliate leaves are simple and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The seed pods are woody and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by water or wind."
