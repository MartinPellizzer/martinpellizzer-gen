    "intro": "Derris leptorhachis, commonly known as the climbing devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
