    "intro": "Dyckia dissitiflora, commonly known as the hairy-leaf dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hairy trichomes. The plant produces striking, red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Dyckia dissitiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
