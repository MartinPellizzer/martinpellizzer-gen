    "intro": "Diplazium multicaudatum, commonly known as the many-tailed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into multiple, narrow segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
