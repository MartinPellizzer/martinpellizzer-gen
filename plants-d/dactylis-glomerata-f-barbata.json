    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. barbata, commonly known as the hairy bents, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its hairy leaf blades and stems, which distinguish it from the typical form. This plant is a perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and pastures. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green flowers."
