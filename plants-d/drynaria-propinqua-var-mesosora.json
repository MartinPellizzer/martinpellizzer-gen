    "intro": "Drynaria propinqua var. mesosora, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and fronds that are typically smaller and more compact compared to the standard variety. The plant exhibits a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical gardens."
