It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. It has a short stem with few leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Disa tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
