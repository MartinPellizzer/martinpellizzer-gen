    "intro": "Dryopteris subincisa, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The fronds are usually evergreen, though they may die back in winter in colder climates."
