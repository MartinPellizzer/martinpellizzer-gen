    "intro": "Diphasium tristachyum, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in groups of three, giving it its species name *tristachyum*. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The plant is notable for its ability to photosynthesize but still relies on its host for water and nutrients."
