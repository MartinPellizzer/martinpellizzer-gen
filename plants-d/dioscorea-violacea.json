    "intro": "Dioscorea violacea, commonly known as the purple yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary economically valuable part of the plant. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are usually hairy. The tubers are used as a food source and have a starchy, sweet flavor similar to other yams."
