    "intro": "Duhaldea cappa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cappa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Duhaldea cappa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a potential medicinal plant in traditional herbal medicine."
