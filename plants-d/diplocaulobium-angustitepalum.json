    "intro": "Diplocaulobium angustitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy white flowers. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its broad, heart-shaped leaves, which are usually covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait common among many water lilies. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
