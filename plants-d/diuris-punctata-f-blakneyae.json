It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like flower structure. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open heathlands or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spiders. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
