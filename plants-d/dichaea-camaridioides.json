    "intro": "Dichaea camaridioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
