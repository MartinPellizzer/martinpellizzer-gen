    "intro": "Diellia erecta f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf diellia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slight bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
