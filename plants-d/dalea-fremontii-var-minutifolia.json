    "intro": "Dalea fremontii var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant features slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, linear leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
