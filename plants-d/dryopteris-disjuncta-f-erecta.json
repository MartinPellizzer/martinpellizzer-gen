    "intro": "Dryopteris disjuncta f. erecta, commonly known as the upright cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features tall, erect fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on cliffs or rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for taxonomists and horticulturists."
