    "intro": "Dichanthelium aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a sharp, needle-like appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
