    "intro": "Dimerostemma reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's dimerostemma, is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of orange-red flowers with prominent yellow stamens. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, typical of many plants in the Apocynaceae family. Dimerostemma reitzii is often found in moist, shaded areas within dense forests."
