    "intro": "Dupatya philodicoides, commonly known as the Philippine fern tree, is a unique plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fern-like fronds and tree-like structure. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a rare trait among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
