It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with a distinct green throat. Native to wet meadows and marshy habitats in Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Its floral structure includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter being showy and often marked with purple or brown spots."
