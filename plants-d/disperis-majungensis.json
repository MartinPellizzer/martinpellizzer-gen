    "intro": "Disperis majungensis, commonly known as the Majungensis Disperis, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
