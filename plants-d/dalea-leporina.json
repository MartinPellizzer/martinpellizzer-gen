    "intro": "Dalea leporina, commonly known as the jackrabbit pea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea leporina is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and native landscaping in desert regions."
