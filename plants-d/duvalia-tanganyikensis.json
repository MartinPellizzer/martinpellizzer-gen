    "intro": "Duvalia tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Tanganyika duvalia, is a species of flowering plant native to the African Great Lakes region, particularly Lake Tanganyika. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the margins of lakes and rivers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
