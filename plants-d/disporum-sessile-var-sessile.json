    "intro": "Disporum sessile var. sessile, commonly known as the western skunk cabbage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, mottled greenish-brown spathe that encloses a spadix bearing small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. It has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy surface that help reduce water loss. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with coniferous forests."
