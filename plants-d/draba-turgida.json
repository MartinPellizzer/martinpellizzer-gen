    "intro": "Draba turgida, commonly known as the turgid whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Draba turgida is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its short stature and rapid growth cycle make it a characteristic component of high-altitude vegetation."
