    "intro": "Delphinium unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often appearing as a single, broad leaf at the base of the plant. Delphinium unifolium is known for its ornamental value but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids."
