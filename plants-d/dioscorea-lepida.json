    "intro": "Dioscorea lepida, commonly known as the slender yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its long, thin stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often harvested for culinary or medicinal purposes. Its growth habit and morphology make it well adapted to shaded, moist environments in its natural habitat. The tubers of Dioscorea lepida are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can be a source of nutrition in certain regions."
