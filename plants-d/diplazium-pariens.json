    "intro": "Diplazium pariens, commonly known as the spreading water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance, often with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats."
