It belongs to the Bambusoideae subfamily and is characterized by its sturdy, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and pale underneath. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly, making it a valuable but sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
