    "intro": "Dysoxylum nagelianum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
