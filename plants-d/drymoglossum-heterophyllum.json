    "intro": "Drymoglossum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, dark green leaves that are often curved at the tips. Its sporophytes are short and stout, with a capsule that is often covered in a thick, dark cuticle. This moss is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
