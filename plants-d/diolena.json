    "intro": "Diolena, commonly known as the marsh violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in wetland and marshy habitats across temperate regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves. Diolena species often have a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help them spread in moist environments. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
