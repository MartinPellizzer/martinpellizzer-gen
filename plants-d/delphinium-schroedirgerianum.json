    "intro": "Delphinium schroedirgerianum, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6dinger's delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Delphinium schroedirgerianum is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
