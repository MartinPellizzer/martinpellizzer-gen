    "intro": "Ditrichanthus, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features opposite or alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. It is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ditrichanthus is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
