    "intro": "Dasystephana kauffmanniana, commonly known as the golden star bush, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant is characterized by its dense foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
