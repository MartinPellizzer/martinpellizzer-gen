    "intro": "Dudleya gnoma, commonly known as the rock dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on cliffs, where it is exposed to strong coastal winds and salt spray. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. Dudleya gnoma is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
