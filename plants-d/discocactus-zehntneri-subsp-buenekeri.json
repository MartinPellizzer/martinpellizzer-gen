    "intro": "Discocactus zehntneri subsp. buenekeri, commonly known as the Goodenough discocactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
