    "intro": "Delphinium clusianum, commonly known as the Clusian larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are known for their distinctive, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Delphinium clusianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
