    "intro": "Dortmanna decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Dortmanna decurrens thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds."
