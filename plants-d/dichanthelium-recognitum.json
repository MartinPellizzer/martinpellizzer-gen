    "intro": "Dichanthelium recognitum, commonly known as the common panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Dichanthelium recognitum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in disturbed sites."
