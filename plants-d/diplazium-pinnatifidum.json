    "intro": "Diplazium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across moist environments. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lacy appearance."
