    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet forests. The plant features delicate, linear fronds with a distinctive serrated edge. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variant is noted for its variability in leaf shape and size, which can vary depending on environmental conditions."
