    "intro": "Dryopteris spectabilis var. phillipiana, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
