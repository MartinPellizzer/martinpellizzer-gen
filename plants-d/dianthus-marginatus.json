    "intro": "Dianthus marginatus, commonly known as the pink rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often tinged with a reddish hue. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Dianthus marginatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
