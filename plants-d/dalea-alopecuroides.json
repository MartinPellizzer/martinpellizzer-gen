It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing ability make it an important species in soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
