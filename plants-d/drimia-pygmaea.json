It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer. The plant grows from a rounded, fleshy bulb and is adapted to arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
