It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm and prefers bright, indirect light. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Dirichletia glaucescens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
