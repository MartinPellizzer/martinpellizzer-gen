    "intro": "Dioscorea pumicicola, commonly known as the pumice yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with ample sunlight. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits. The tubers of Dioscorea pumicicola are valued for their starchy content and are used in traditional cuisines across its native range."
