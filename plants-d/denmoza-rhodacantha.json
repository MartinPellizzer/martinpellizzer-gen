    "intro": "Denmoza rhodacantha, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins contrasting against dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
