It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. Disparago ericoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
