It features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems growing horizontally and producing new shoots from the base. The plant produces dense clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
