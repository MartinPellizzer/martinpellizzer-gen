    "intro": "Dryopteris maranguensis, commonly known as the Marangu fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense thickets in the undergrowth of humid forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in local communities, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
