    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. pallida, commonly known as the pale dactylis, is a variant of the dactylis grass species. It is characterized by its pale green foliage and reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense turf. The pale coloration of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other dactylis varieties."
