    "intro": "Dissorhynchium, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, showy flowers and specialized structures called lip petals, which aid in pollination. Dissorhynchium species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. They possess pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing them to survive in variable conditions. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
