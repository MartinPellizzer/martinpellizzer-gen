    "intro": "Dracaena nigra, commonly known as the black dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Dracaena nigra thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its striking foliage and relatively low maintenance make it a favored ornamental plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
