    "intro": "Dendrotrophe umbellata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf dendrotrophe, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in swampy areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, while its flowers emit a subtle fragrance. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its potential use in traditional medicine."
