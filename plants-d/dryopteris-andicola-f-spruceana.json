    "intro": "Dryopteris andicola f. spruceana, commonly known as the Andean wood fern, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
