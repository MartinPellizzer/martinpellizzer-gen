    "intro": "Digitaria enodis, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Digitaria enodis has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
