    "intro": "Dalbergia pulchra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small and typically pale yellow or greenish. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, Dalbergia pulchra is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for horticultural purposes."
