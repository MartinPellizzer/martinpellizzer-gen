    "intro": "Dichocarpum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
