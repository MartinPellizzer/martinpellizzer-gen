It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Dendrochilum anomalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
