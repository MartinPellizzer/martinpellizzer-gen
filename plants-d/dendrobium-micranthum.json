    "intro": "Dendrobium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Dendrobium micranthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
