    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea f. villosa, commonly known as the velvet ebony, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black bark, which is often covered with a fine, velvety pubescence. The leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate, and have a glossy surface with prominent veins. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are initially green and turn red when mature. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and decorative items."
