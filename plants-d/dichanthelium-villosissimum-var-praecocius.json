    "intro": "Dichanthelium villosissimum var. praecocius, commonly known as the early dwarf ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its early flowering habit, which occurs before the more common varietal form of Dichanthelium villosissimum."
