It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
