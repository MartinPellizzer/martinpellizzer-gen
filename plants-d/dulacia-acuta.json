    "intro": "Dulacia acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches itself to the stems of other plants, forming a dense network of tendrils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers produce small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Dulacia acuta is found in various regions, often in disturbed or open habitats where it can easily find a host."
