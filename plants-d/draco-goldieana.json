    "intro": "Draco goldieana, commonly known as the golden drake, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble the scales of a dragon. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and aesthetic value, it is highly sought after by botanists and collectors alike."
