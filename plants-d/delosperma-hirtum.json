    "intro": "Delosperma hirtum, commonly known as the frost plant or woolly ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
