    "intro": "Dipladenia surinamensis, commonly known as the surinam gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a trailing vine, with heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dipladenia surinamensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
