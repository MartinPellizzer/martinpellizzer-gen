    "intro": "Dracaena balmoreana, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with striking red margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena balmoreana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
