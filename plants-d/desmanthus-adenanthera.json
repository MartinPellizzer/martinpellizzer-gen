    "intro": "Desmanthus adenanthera, commonly known as the hairy desmanthus, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Desmanthus adenanthera is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
