    "intro": "Dryopteris crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, broad veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris crassinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
