    "intro": "Disteganthus morii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a small, perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, stout stem and a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the warmer months. Disteganthus morii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
