    "intro": "Deyeuxia eminens var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow false rice, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
