    "intro": "Delphinium parryi subsp. eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided with a hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
