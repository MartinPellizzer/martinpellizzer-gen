    "intro": "Deguelia oligosperma, commonly known as the silky tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical areas for horticultural purposes. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
