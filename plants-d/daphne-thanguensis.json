    "intro": "Daphne thanguensis, commonly known as the Bhutanese daphne, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
