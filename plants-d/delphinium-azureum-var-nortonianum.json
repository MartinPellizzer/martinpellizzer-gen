It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of showy, sky-blue to violet flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem. The species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
