    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. paleaceolobata, commonly known as the pale-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive, pale green to yellowish fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to temperate regions of North America. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that distinguishes it from other ferns in the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
