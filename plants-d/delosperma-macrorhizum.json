    "intro": "Delosperma macrorhizum, commonly known as the large-rooted ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a hardy addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
