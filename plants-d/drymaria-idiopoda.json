    "intro": "Drymaria idiopoda, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The species is well adapted to poor soils and high sunlight exposure, making it a hardy component of desert ecosystems."
