    "intro": "Deyeuxia neglecta var. borealis, commonly known as the northern false oat, is a cool-season grass native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its wetland environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
