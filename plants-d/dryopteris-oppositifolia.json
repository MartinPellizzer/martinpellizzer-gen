    "intro": "Dryopteris oppositifolia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base and a feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
