    "intro": "Delphinium frigidum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a hairy texture. Delphinium frigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous to livestock and humans."
