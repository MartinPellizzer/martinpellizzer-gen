    "intro": "Daphnopsis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone daphnopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific calcareous habitats. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Daphnopsis calcicola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
