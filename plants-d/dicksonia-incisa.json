    "intro": "Dicksonia incisa, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. Dicksonia incisa thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories."
