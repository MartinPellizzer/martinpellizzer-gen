    "intro": "Daphne arbuscula f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form a dense ground cover in rock gardens or as a border plant."
