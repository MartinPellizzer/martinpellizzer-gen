    "intro": "Dierama pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf dierama, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-gray in color, arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped flower spikes during the summer months, which are adorned with small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
