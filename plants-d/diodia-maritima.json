    "intro": "Diodia maritima, commonly known as sea dittany, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing shrub with aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its adaptability to salty, well-drained soils makes it a common sight in dunes and rocky coastal habitats. Diodia maritima is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
