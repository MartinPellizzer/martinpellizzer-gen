    "intro": "Davallia mariesii, commonly known as the Mariesii spleenwort, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant grows epiphytically or lithophytically, often on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
