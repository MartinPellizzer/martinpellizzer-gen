These plants are characterized by their square stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often violet or blue flowers. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Dracocephalum species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The genus includes several species, such as Dracocephalum moldavica, which is cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage."
