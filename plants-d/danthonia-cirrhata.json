    "intro": "Danthonia cirrhata, commonly known as silky grass or silky danthonia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
