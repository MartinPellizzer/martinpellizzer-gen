    "intro": "Dimorphanthes procera, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Dimorphanthes procera is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
