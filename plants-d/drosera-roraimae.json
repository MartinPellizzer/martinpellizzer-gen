    "intro": "Drosera roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it forms dense rosettes of bright green leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or red, adding to its visual appeal. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Drosera genus."
