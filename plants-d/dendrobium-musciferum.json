    "intro": "Dendrobium musciferum, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth of roots and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium musciferum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
