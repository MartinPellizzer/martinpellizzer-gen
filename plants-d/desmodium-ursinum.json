    "intro": "Desmodium ursinum, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization. Desmodium ursinum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions."
