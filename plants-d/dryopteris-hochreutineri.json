    "intro": "Dryopteris hochreutineri, commonly known as the Hochreutiner's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
