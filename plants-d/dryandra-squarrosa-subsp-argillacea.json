    "intro": "Dryandra squarrosa subsp. argillacea, commonly known as the argillaceous dryandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or clay soils, often found in heathland environments. It is a member of the Proteaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with specialized adaptations for nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
