    "intro": "Diplazium lindbergii var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 shield fern, is a variety of the shield fern genus Diplazium. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Colombia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
