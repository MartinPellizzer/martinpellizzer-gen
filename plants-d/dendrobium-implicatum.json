    "intro": "Dendrobium implicatum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features long, thin stems that coil around its support, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a faint fragrance, blooming in clusters. Dendrobium implicatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
