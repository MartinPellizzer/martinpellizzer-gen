It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with prominent veins. Its inflorescence consists of a paniculate arrangement of spikelets, which are small and usually clustered at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
