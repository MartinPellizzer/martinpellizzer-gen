    "intro": "Dalea lucida, commonly known as the pale lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Dalea lucida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
