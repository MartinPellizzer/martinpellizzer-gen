    "intro": "Duchesnia, commonly known as the \"false sandwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and they often grow in moist, rocky or sandy soils. Duchesnia species are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and their ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and their ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
