    "intro": "Dryopteris reptans var. conformis, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and adaptability."
