    "intro": "Dryopteris rioverdensis, commonly known as the Rio Verde fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter underneath. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores. The Rio Verde fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
