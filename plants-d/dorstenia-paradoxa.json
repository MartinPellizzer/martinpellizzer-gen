    "intro": "Dorstenia paradoxa, commonly known as the \"Pandora's Box\" or \"Devil's Fig,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiraled leaves that curl tightly around its stem, forming a protective structure. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and it produces a fruit that resembles a fig. Dorstenia paradoxa is often grown as a curiosity due to its unusual appearance and slow growth rate."
