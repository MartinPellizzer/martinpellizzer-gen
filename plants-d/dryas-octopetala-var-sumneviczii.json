    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. sumneviczii, commonly known as the alpine dryas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters of eight, giving it the species name \"octopetala.\" It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Dryas octopetala."
