    "intro": "Desmoncus horridus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western burrweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a prickly, bristly structure, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats."
