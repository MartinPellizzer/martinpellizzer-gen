    "intro": "Doliocarpus dentosus var. piauhiensis, commonly known as the Piauhi palm, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
