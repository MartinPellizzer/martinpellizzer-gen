    "intro": "Dendrobangia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Dendrobangia species are characterized by their long, wiry stems and showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. They require high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts. Their unique appearance and relatively easy care make them a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
