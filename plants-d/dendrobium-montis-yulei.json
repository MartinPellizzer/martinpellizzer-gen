    "intro": "Dendrobium montis-yulei, commonly known as the Yule's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids, many of which are prized for their ornamental value. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
