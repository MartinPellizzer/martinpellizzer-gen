    "intro": "Dryopteris quadriaurita, commonly known as the four-auricle wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and soil conditions."
