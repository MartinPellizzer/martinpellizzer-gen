    "intro": "Dracaena ferrea var. rubens, commonly known as the red dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often have a reddish or purplish tinge along the edges and midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena ferrea var. rubens is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
