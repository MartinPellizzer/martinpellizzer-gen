    "intro": "Deinandra floribunda, commonly known as the African firethorn, is a flowering shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Deinandra floribunda is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
