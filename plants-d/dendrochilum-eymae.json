    "intro": "Dendrochilum eymae, commonly known as the Eyma's tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrochilum eymae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
