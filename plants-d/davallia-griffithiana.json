    "intro": "Davallia griffithiana, commonly known as the Hart's-tongue fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Davallia griffithiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
