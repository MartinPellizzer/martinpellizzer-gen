    "intro": "Dendrobium farmeri var. album, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
