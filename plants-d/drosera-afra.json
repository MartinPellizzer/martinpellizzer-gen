    "intro": "Drosera afra, commonly known as the African Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Drosera afra is a low-growing plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments."
