    "intro": "Diplazium assimile, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
