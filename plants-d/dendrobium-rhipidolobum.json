    "intro": "Dendrobium rhipidolobum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with red or orange markings. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
