It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species known for their milky sap. The plant typically features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
