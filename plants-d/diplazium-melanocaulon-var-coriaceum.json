    "intro": "Diplazium melanocaulon var. coriaceum, commonly known as the coriaceous shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
