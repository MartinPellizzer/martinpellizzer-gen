    "intro": "Dracophilus, commonly known as the dragon's blood plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its striking red or orange berries that exude a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Dracophilus species are valued not only for their ornamental appeal but also for their ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
