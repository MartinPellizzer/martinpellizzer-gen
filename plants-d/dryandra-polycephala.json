    "intro": "Dryandra polycephala, commonly known as the hairy dryandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Western Australia and is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. It produces woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation areas and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
