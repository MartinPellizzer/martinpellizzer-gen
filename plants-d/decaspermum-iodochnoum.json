    "intro": "Decaspermum iodochnoum, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Decaspermum iodochnoum plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
