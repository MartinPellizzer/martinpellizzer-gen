    "intro": "Dichanthelium harvillii, commonly known as Harvill's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Dichanthelium harvillii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
