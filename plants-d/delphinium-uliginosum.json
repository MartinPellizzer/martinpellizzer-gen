    "intro": "Delphinium uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture. Delphinium uliginosum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along riverbanks."
