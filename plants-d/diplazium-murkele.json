    "intro": "Diplazium murkele, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Diplazium murkele thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies."
