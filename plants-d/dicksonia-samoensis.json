    "intro": "Dicksonia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant produces a large, umbrella-shaped frond that can reach several meters in diameter. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat. Dicksonia samoensis is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
