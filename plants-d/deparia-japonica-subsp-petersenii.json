    "intro": "Deparia japonica subsp. petersenii, commonly known as the Petersen's forest fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings."
