    "intro": "Desmodium rotundifolium, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets and small, hairy stipules along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its small, round, brown seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods. Desmodium rotundifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
