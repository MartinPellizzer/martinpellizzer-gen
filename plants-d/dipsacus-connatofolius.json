    "intro": "Dipsacus connatofolius, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, rough stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces tall, spiky flower heads that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in waste areas. The plant is known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the bracts catch the wind to carry the seeds away."
