    "intro": "Digitaria marginata var. nubica, commonly known as the mountain dropseed, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
