    "intro": "Dichanthelium nitidum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky panicum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Dichanthelium nitidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
