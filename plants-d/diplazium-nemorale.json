    "intro": "Diplazium nemorale, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Diplazium nemorale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
