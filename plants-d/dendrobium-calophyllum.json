    "intro": "Dendrobium calophyllum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red markings, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its stems are typically cylindrical and can grow quite long, often reaching several feet in height. Dendrobium calophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
