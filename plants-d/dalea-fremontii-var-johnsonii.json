It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow to reddish pink flowers make it a distinctive species within the Dalea genus. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
