    "intro": "Dryopteris effusa f. typica, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that are generally shorter and more robust than the sterile ones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
