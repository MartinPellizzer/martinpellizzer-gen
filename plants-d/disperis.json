    "intro": "Disperis, commonly known as the African orchid or genus of orchids, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions across Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Disperis species typically grow as herbs or small shrubs, often with tuberous roots that help them survive in dry conditions. Their flowers are usually showy, with colorful petals and a distinctive lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental beauty and are cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
