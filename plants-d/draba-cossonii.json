    "intro": "Draba cossonii, commonly known as the Cosson's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Draba cossonii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
