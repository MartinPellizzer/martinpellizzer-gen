    "intro": "Diplazium arayae, commonly known as the Arawak fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, thick rhizome and compound leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium arayae is often found in association with other epiphytic plants, thriving in the canopy layers of tropical forests."
