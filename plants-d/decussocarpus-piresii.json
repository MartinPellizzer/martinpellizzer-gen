    "intro": "Decussocarpus piresii, commonly known as the Pires' decussocarpus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral and fruit structures. The plant exhibits a decussate arrangement of its leaves, where opposite leaves are staggered, providing efficient light capture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals, and it produces capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
