    "intro": "Dendrophthoe heyneanus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
