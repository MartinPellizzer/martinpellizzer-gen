    "intro": "Diospyros umlovok, commonly known as the Umlovok ebony, is a species of flowering plant in the Ebenaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Uganda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns from green to yellow when mature."
