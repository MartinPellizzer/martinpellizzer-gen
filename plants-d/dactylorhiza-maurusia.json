    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maurusia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system that helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. Dactylorhiza maurusia is an important species for biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
