    "intro": "Dryopteris adenopteris, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble a spoon, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often clustered at the base. Dryopteris adenopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
