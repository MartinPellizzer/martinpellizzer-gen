    "intro": "Dryopteris sewellii, commonly known as the Sewell's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into numerous small, serrated segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish dense colonies over time."
