    "intro": "Disteira, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Disteira species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
