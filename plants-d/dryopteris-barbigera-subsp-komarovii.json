    "intro": "Dryopteris barbigera subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- to tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
