    "intro": "Dianthus tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dianthus tatrae is considered a rare and endangered species."
