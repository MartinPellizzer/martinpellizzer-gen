    "intro": "Dracocephalum diversifolium, commonly known as the diverse-leaved dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and hairy stems that often bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Dracocephalum diversifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
