    "intro": "Danthonia cachemyriana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to the southern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and ornamental landscaping."
