    "intro": "Delphinium taliense var. platycentrum, commonly known as the broad-centred larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemose inflorescences, with petals that are typically broader than those of other delphinium species. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
