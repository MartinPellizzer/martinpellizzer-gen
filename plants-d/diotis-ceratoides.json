    "intro": "Diotis ceratoides, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like bracts that give it its common name, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. Diotis ceratoides is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators."
