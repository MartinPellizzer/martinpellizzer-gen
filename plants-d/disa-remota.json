    "intro": "Disa remota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Disa remota is considered a threatened species."
