    "intro": "Dryopteris nephrodioides var. biolleyi, commonly known as the Biolley's water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
