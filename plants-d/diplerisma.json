    "intro": "Diplerisma, commonly known as the \"southern bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It consists of only two recognized species, Diplerisma acuminatum and Diplerisma hirtellum, both native to South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The genus is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
