    "intro": "Drosera graniticola, commonly known as the granite sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the quartz and granite outcrops of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic, and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a dense inflorescence and bloom during the warmer months. The species is adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it a resilient and unique example of a carnivorous plant."
