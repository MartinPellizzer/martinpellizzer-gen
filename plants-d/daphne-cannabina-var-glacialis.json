    "intro": "Daphne cannabina var. glacialis, commonly known as the Alpine Daphne, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its botanical features include small, elliptical leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
