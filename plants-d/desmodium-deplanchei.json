    "intro": "Desmodium deplanchei, commonly known as the broadleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
