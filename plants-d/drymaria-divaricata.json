    "intro": "Drymaria divaricata, commonly known as the spreading sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in sandy or gravelly areas. Drymaria divaricata is often found in regions with low rainfall and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
