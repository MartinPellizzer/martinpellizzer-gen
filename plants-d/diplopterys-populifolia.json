    "intro": "Diplopterys populifolia, commonly known as the tree of life, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, hence its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
