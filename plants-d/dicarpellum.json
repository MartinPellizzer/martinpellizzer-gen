    "intro": "Dicarpellum, commonly known as the \"two-chambered fruit,\" is a type of fruit found in certain flowering plants. It is characterized by its two distinct chambers or lobes, each containing seeds. This structure is typically derived from the fusion of two carpels, which are the female reproductive organs of the flower. The dicarpellum is often found in plants of the family Malvaceae, such as hibiscus and cotton. Its unique morphology plays a role in seed dispersal and plant reproduction."
