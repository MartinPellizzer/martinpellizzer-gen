    "intro": "Doratoxylon littorale, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Doratoxylon littorale thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the coast and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous stems were historically used by indigenous communities for making rope and other textiles."
