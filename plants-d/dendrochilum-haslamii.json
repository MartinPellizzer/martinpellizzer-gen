    "intro": "Dendrochilum haslamii, commonly known as the Hasmal's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white with intricate patterns and are borne on terminal racemes. Dendrochilum haslamii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
