    "intro": "Deyeuxia pyramidalis var. borealis, commonly known as the northern pyramidal sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a pyramid-like shape, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in a dense, cylindrical structure. This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor drainage and nutrient-poor soils."
