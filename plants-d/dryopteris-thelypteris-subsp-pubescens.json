    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a shield-shaped base and a slender, often hairy rachis. The undersides of the pinnae are covered with fine, soft pubescence, which gives the subspecies its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
