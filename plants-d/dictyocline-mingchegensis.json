    "intro": "Dictyocline mingchegensis, commonly known as the Mingcheng star-moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort found in specific mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus structure. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, often growing on moist, shaded rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with distinct antheridiola and archegonia that facilitate sexual reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern."
