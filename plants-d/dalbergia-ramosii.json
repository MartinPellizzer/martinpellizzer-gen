    "intro": "Dalbergia ramosii, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich golden hue, which makes it highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
