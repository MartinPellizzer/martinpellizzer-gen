It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season."
