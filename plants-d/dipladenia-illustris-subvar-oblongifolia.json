    "intro": "Dipladenia illustris subvar. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf ninebark, is a vigorous climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are oblong in shape, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its fast growth and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for trellises or as a ground cover."
