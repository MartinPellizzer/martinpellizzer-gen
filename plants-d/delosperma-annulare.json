    "intro": "Delosperma annulare, commonly known as the \"ice plant,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a low-growing perennial that spreads via runners, forming dense mats. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
