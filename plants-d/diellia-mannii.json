    "intro": "Diellia mannii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated fruit capsules. Its sap contains milky latex, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Diellia mannii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
