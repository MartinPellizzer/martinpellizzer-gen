    "intro": "Draba hirta var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It typically features small, basal leaves that are hairy and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems that rise from the base of the plant. Draba hirta var. rupestris is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly slopes and rocky outcrops."
