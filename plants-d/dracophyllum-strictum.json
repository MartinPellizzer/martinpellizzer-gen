    "intro": "Dracophyllum strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved draco, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Dracophyllum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance."
