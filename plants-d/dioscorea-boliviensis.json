    "intro": "Dioscorea boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian yam, is a tuberous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual. Its tubers are a source of nutrition and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The botanical features of D. boliviensis make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
