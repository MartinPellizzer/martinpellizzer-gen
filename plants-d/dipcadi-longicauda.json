    "intro": "Dipcadi longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its unique structure includes a long, slender stem that can extend several centimeters, giving it its common name. Due to its parasitic nature and specialized growth habits, it plays a niche role in its ecosystem."
