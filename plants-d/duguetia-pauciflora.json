    "intro": "Duguetia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its elliptical, glossy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Duguetia pauciflora plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small vertebrates."
