It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Daphne pendula is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is often used in borders or as a specimen plant."
