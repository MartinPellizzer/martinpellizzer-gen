It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 50 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense canopy. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of woody pods containing the valuable Brazil nuts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy surface and a prominent midrib. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
