    "intro": "Dryandra plumosa subsp. denticulata, commonly known as the serrated dryandra, is a unique member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage and is often found in sandy soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting native pollinators. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
