    "intro": "Dissotis, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Commelinaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored inflorescences that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Dissotis species typically have strap-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
