    "intro": "Dryopteris scalpturoides var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It features fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, scaly texture on the underside. The plant is native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, often found in forested areas with acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and rocky substrates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to add texture and interest to shaded garden spaces."
