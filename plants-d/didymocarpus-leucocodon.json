    "intro": "Didymocarpus leucocodon, commonly known as the white-flowered flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with lanceolate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display. The species is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil."
