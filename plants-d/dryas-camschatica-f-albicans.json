    "intro": "Dryas camschatica f. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered mountain avens, is a rare and striking variant of the mountain avens species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically silver-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral coloration and ecological adaptations."
