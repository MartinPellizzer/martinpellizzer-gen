    "intro": "Dolichos tenuicaulis subsp. lygodioides, commonly known as the slender stemmed dolichos, is a climbing legume native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
