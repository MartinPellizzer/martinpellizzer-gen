    "intro": "Draba aizoides subsp. zmudae, commonly known as the Polish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This subspecies is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
