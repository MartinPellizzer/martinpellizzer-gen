    "intro": "Dryopteris andina, commonly known as the Andean wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense network of roots that help it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments at high elevations."
