    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of spurred, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often glandular, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value."
