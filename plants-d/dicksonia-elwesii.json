    "intro": "Dicksonia elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique, elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps it retain moisture and support its height."
