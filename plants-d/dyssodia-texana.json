    "intro": "Dyssodia texana, commonly known as the Texas dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dyssodia texana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
