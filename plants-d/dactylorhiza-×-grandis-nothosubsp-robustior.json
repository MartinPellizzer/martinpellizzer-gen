    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 grandis nothosubsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust greater marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and other moist habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet environments, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often found in areas with fluctuating water levels."
