    "intro": "Dactyliophora thespesiae, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikes and are not particularly showy. Dactyliophora thespesiae is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
