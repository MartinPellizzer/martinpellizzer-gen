    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa, commonly known as the overlooked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Dactylorchis genus. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and relatively uncommon occurrence. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
