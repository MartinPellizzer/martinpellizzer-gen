    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita var. resinifera, commonly known as the resinous wood fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a waxy, resinous coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
