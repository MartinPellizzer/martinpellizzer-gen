    "intro": "Dryopteris ulei, commonly known as the Ule's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
