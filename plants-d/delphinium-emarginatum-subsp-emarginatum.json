    "intro": "Delphinium emarginatum subsp. emarginatum, commonly known as the fringed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, erect stems covered in dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, with each bloom characterized by a distinctive fringed appearance at the base of the petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and deeply lobed, often with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This subspecies is known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
