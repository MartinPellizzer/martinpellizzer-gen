    "intro": "Drosera dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which the plant then digests to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
