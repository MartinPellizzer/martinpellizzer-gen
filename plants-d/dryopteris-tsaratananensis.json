    "intro": "Dryopteris tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana shield fern, is an endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique morphology. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust, and the fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and potential ecological significance."
