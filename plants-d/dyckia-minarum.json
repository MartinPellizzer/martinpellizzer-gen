    "intro": "Dyckia minarum, commonly known as the silver pine or the feather plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking, branched inflorescences with showy, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Dyckia minarum is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light. It is relatively drought-tolerant and makes a striking addition to rock gardens or indoor collections."
