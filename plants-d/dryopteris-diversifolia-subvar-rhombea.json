    "intro": "Dryopteris diversifolia subvar. rhombea, commonly known as the rhombic wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features compound, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive rhombic shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The rhombic wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
