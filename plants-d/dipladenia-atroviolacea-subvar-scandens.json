    "intro": "Dipladenia atroviolacea subvar. scandens, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an excellent choice for trellises, arbors, or as a ground cover in tropical gardens."
