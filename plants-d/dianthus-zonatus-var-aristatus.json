    "intro": "Dianthus zonatus var. aristatus, commonly known as the fringed pinks, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-red flowers with fringed petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
