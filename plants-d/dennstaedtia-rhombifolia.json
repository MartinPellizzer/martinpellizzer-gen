    "intro": "Dennstaedtia rhombifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves that are typically divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
