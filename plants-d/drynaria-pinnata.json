    "intro": "Drynaria pinnata, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique ability to survive extreme desiccation. It is a epiphytic fern that thrives on tree trunks and rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant's fronds are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance that becomes visible when rehydrated. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to anchor itself to surfaces. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
