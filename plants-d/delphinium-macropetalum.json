    "intro": "Delphinium macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled larkspur, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in racemes, with large, petal-like bracts that give it its common name. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets and a rough, hairy texture. Delphinium macropetalum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and alpine displays."
