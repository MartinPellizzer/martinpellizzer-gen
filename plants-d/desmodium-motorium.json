    "intro": "Desmodium motorium, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rapid leaf movements in response to touch. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to South America. The plant has trifoliate leaves that close when disturbed, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by pods that contain several seeds. Desmodium motorium is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its unique behavior and adaptability to various soil types."
