    "intro": "Dyckia burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange. Its foliage is adapted to capture and store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is popular as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
