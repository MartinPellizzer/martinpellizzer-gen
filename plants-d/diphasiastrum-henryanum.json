It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, golden-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, carpet-like mats."
