    "intro": "Diplobryum minutale, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, closely packed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems called setae. Diplobryum minutale plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
