    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 hutohanum, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium sphaericum. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, round sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is popular among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts."
