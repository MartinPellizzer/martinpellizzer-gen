    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. concordiana, commonly known as the Concord fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
