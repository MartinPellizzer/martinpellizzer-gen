    "intro": "Distemonanthus benthamianus, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces oval-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody pulp, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
