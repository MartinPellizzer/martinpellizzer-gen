    "intro": "Dioclea megacarpa, commonly known as the giant cupseed or Brazilian apple, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces fruit that is typically a bright red or orange berry, which contains numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Dioclea megacarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown as a decorative plant in warm climates."
