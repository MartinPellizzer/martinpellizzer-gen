    "intro": "Dumerilia alamanii, commonly known as the Alamanii dumeria, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other well-known plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often found in moist, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat understudied species."
