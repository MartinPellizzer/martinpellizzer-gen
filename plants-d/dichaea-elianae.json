    "intro": "Dichaea elianae, commonly known as the Erianthum orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates to flourish. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower spike during the growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea elianae is considered a species of conservation concern."
