    "intro": "Dalbergia abrahamii, commonly known as African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to central and eastern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
