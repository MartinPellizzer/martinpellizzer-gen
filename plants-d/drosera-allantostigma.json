    "intro": "Drosera allantostigma, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden dew to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its leaves are broad and often have a rosette structure, with each leaf bearing numerous hair-like structures. The flowers are small and usually pink or red, appearing on a single stem above the rosette."
