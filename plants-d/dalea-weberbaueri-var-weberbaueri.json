    "intro": "Dalea weberbaueri var. weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, and it has trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
