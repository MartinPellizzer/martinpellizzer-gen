It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
