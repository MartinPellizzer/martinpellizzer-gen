    "intro": "Drosera sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
