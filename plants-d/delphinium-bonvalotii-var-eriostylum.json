It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes."
