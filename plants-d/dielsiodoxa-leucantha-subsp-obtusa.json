    "intro": "Dielsiodoxa leucantha subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dielsiodoxa, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in small umbels, and are adapted for pollination by insects. The subspecies obtusa is distinguished by its more acute leaf tips and slightly shorter inflorescences compared to other subspecies of the species."
