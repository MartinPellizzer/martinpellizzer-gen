It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Dysoxylum papuanum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
