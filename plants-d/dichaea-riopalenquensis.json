    "intro": "Dichaea riopalenquensis, commonly known as the R\u00edo Palenqu\u00e9n bromeliad, is a species of bromeliad native to Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom from a central stem, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help in water retention and light absorption. This species thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in cloud forests."
