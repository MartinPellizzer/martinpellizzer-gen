    "intro": "Desmos ramarowii, commonly known as the rock wall vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in its attachment to surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Desmos ramarowii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth."
