    "intro": "Disporopsis jinfushanensis, commonly known as the Jinfushan disporopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spores rather than seeds, typical of its fern family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
