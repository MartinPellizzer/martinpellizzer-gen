It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other well-known genera like ebony and persimmon. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
