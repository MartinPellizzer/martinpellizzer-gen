It is characterized by its distinctive, clover-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Delphinastrum urceolatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
