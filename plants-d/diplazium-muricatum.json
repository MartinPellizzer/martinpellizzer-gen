    "intro": "Diplazium muricatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has serrated leaf margins and a dense, hairy texture on its underside, which gives it its common name. Diplazium muricatum typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
