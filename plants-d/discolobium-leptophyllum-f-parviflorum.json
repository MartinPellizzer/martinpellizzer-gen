    "intro": "Discolobium leptophyllum f. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered discolobium, is a rare plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to specific regions of Australia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
