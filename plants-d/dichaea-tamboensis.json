    "intro": "Dichaea tamboensis, commonly known as the Tamboensian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a series of leaves and flower spikes. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
