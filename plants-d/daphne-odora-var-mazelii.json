    "intro": "Daphne odora var. mazelii, commonly known as the Chinese daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early bloomer in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it is relatively low maintenance once established. The flowers are highly aromatic, often described as having a scent reminiscent of jasmine or citrus."
