    "intro": "Dolianthus kairoi, commonly known as the Kairoi's flame, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dolianthus kairoi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
