    "intro": "Discaria nitida, commonly known as the white bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of white flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom in spring and summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Discaria nitida is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its use in landscaping."
