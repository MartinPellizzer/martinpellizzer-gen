    "intro": "Dryopteris subobscura, commonly known as the dark shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature common among ferns. The plant's rhizomes are subterranean, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil."
