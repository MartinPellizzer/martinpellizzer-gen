    "intro": "Dockrillia hepatica, commonly known as liverworts, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the group Hepaticae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus that can be leafy or filamentous. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring. Dockrillia hepatica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
