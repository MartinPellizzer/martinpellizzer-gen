    "intro": "Dicarpaea, commonly known as the \"dwarf broom\" or \"broomweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small shrubs or herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their small, often yellow or greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Dicarpaea species typically have compound leaves and produce legume-like pods containing seeds. These plants are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including woodland edges and rocky areas."
