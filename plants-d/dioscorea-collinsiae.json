    "intro": "Dioscorea collinsiae, commonly known as Collins' yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
