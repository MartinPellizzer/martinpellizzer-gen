It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with hairy stems and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in grasslands and woodland areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
