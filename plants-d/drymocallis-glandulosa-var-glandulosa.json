It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
