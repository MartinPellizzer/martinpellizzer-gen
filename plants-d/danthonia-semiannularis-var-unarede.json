It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden within the foliage. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
