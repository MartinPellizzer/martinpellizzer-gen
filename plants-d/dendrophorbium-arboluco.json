    "intro": "Dendrophorbium arboluco, commonly known as the skyward orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the misty highlands of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of ancient trees in cloud forests. The plant's roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, allowing it to flourish without soil. Its striking, fragrant flowers bloom in shades of violet and white, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dendrophorbium arboluco is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
