    "intro": "Debia krewanhensis, commonly known as the Krewanh mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
