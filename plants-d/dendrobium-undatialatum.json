    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dendrobium unditialatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length, with clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. Its flowers are typically tubular and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins. Dendrobium unditialatum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
