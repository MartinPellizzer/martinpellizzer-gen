    "intro": "Dendrobium fornicatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees or rocks, often in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom sequentially along its stems. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal droughts. Dendrobium fornicatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
