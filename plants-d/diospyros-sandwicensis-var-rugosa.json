It is characterized by its thick, rough, bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red, fleshy fruits. The fruits are edible when fully ripe and have a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii."
