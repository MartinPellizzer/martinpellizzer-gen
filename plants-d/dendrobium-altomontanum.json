    "intro": "Dendrobium altomontanum, commonly known as the high mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height, often with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its blooms are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Dendrobium altomontanum thrives in humid, cool environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
