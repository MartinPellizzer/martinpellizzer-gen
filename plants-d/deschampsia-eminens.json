    "intro": "Deschampsia eminens, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Deschampsia eminens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
