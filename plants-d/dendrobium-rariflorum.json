    "intro": "Dendrobium rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium rariflorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
