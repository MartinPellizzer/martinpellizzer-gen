    "intro": "Dendrobium calyptratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its often-dry tropical habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium calyptratum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
