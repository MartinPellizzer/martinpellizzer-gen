It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent scent. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. Draba porrecta has basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are erect and bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
