    "intro": "Diphylax, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants typically have basal leaves that are either lobed or entire, with some species exhibiting a rosette growth habit. The flowers are usually yellow, with ray florets that resemble those of true dandelions. Diphylax species are often found in grasslands and open habitats, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators."
