It is characterized by its woody, tree-like structure and long, arching stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis in shaded forest environments. Dendrochilum quinquelobum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing on trees or rocks in montane regions."
