    "intro": "Dryopteris laevigata, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
