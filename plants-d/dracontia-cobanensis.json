    "intro": "Dracontia cobanensis, commonly known as the Cob\u00e1n dragon fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of northern Guatemala. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Dracontia cobanensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
