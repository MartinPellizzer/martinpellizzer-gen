    "intro": "Draba schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's whitlow grass, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Its life cycle is adapted to short growing seasons, and it relies on seasonal snowmelt for moisture. Draba schweinfurthii is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing nectar for pollinators."
