    "intro": "Daphne obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and emit a strong, spicy fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
