It is characterized by its stout, fleshy roots and its distinctive inflorescence of red to orange bottlebrush-like spikes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
