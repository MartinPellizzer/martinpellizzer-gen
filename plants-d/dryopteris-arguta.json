    "intro": "Dryopteris arguta, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of its fertile leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Dryopteris arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
