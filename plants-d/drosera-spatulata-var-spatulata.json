It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers in summer, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is a hardy species that can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and ability to capture prey make it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
