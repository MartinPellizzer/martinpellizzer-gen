It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The wood of Dalbergia grandistipula is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, making it a sought-after material in traditional and modern crafts."
