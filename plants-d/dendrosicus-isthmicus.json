    "intro": "Dendrosicus isthmicus, commonly known as the Isthmus tree snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell. The shell is typically light to dark brown in color, with a smooth surface and a pointed apex. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it inhabits humid forest environments. Due to its slow movement and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized mollusk."
