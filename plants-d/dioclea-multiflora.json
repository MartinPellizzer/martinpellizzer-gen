    "intro": "Dioclea multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are covered in fine, velvety hairs. Dioclea multiflora produces small, yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal."
