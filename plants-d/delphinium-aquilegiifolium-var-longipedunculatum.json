    "intro": "Delphinium aquilegiifolium var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long peduncled larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the genus Aquilegia, giving it its species name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support its showy inflorescences."
