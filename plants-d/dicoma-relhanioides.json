    "intro": "Dicoma relhanioides, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
