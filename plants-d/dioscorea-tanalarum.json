    "intro": "Dioscorea tanalarum, commonly known as the Tanalara yam, is a climbing vine native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. The tubers are generally white or pale yellow and are used in local cuisines for their starchy, mild flavor."
