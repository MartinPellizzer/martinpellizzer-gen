It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots, which are its primary edible part. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its nutritional value, it has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for food and medicinal purposes."
