    "intro": "Discocactus goianus, commonly known as the Goianus discocactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Discocactus goianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
