    "intro": "Dipoma iberideum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited dipoma, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or scrubland habitats. Its small, white or greenish flowers are arranged in umbels, and the leaves are pinnately divided with a hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its densely hairy fruits, which contribute to its common name."
