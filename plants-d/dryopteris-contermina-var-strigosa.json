    "intro": "Dryopteris contermina var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
