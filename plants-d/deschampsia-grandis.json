    "intro": "Deschampsia grandis, commonly known as tall bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping. Deschampsia grandis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
