    "intro": "Dicliptera nemorum, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Dicliptera nemorum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
