    "intro": "Dieterichia minor, commonly known as the small dieterichia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dieterichia minor thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
