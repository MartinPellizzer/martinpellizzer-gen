    "intro": "Diphysa americana, commonly known as the American diphysa, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, white or pale green flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat, which helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. The plant is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
