    "intro": "Dalea verna, commonly known as early dalea, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea verna plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
