It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval leaves with short, stiff hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
