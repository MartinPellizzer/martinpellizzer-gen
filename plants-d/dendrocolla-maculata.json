    "intro": "Dendrocolla maculata, commonly known as the spotted tree fern, is a unique species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are often marked with spots or streaks, contributing to its common name. Dendrocolla maculata plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
