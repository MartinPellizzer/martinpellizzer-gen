    "intro": "Dulcamara flexuosa var. hastiifolia, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, turn from green to red as they mature. This variety is distinguished by its slightly elongated, hastate leaves compared to the typical form of Dulcamara flexuosa."
