    "intro": "Drymocallis oregana, commonly known as the Oregon gallberry, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Drymocallis oregana is also known for its ability to form galls, which are abnormal growths caused by insect infestations."
