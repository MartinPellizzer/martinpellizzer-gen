    "intro": "Dendropanax caudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
