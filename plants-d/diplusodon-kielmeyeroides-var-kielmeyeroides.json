    "intro": "Diplusodon kielmeyeroides var. kielmeyeroides, commonly known as the Kielmeyer's ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, bushy habit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its hardy, woody structure makes it well adapted to humid, tropical climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
