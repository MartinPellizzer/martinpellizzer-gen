It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant."
