    "intro": "Dalbergia intermedia, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
