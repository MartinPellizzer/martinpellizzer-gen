It is characterized by its unique spiraling growth habit, where the stems twist around supporting structures in a helical pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Dactylostemon verticillatus is often found in coastal and woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
