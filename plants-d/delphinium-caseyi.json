    "intro": "Delphinium caseyi, commonly known as the Sierra delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Delphinium caseyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
