    "intro": "Dianella nemorosa, commonly known as the silver lily or forest lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, silver-green leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels at the tips of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dianella nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
