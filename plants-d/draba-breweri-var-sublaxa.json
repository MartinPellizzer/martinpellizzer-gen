    "intro": "Draba breweri var. sublaxa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada draba, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
