    "intro": "Delphinium hutchinsoniae, commonly known as the Hutchinson's larkspur, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
