    "intro": "Dissotis tanganjikae, commonly known as Lake Tanganyika water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Lake Tanganyika region in Africa. It has broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed properly."
