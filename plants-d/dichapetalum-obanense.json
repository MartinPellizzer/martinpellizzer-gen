It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky, mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
