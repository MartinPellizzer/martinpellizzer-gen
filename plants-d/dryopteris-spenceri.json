    "intro": "Dryopteris spenceri, commonly known as the Spenser's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
