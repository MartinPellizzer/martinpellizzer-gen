    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 convoluta, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a hybrid fern that combines characteristics of several Dryopteris species. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is noted for its distinctive, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into lush, compound fronds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
