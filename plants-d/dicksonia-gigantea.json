    "intro": "Dicksonia gigantea, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network beneath the soil, helping to stabilize the trunk and absorb nutrients. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique combination of features makes Dicksonia gigantea a striking and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
