    "intro": "Dacryodes floribunda, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by yellowish or orange fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable source of timber and its use in traditional medicine. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its adaptability to different climatic conditions."
