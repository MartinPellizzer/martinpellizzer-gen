    "intro": "Dalbergia foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
