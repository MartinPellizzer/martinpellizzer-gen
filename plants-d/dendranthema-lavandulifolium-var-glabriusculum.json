It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that resemble lavender leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
