It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
