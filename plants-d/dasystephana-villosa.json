    "intro": "Dasystephana villosa, commonly known as the woolly stephania, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or villose, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of horticultural circles."
