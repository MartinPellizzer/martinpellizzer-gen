    "intro": "Daviesia debilior subsp. debilior, commonly known as the slender Daviesia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
