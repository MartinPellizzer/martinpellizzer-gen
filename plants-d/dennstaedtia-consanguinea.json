    "intro": "Dennstaedtia consanguinea, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
