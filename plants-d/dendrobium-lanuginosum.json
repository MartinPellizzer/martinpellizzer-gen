    "intro": "Dendrobium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branched stem covered in soft, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom in clusters. Dendrobium lanuginosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
