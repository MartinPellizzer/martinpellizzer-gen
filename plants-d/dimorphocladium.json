    "intro": "Dimorphocladium, commonly known as the two-form clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Dimorphocladium species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. These ancient plants are often used in paleobotanical studies to understand the evolution of early land plants."
