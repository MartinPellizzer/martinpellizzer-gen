    "intro": "Dontostemon senilis subsp. gubanovii, commonly known as the Gubanov's senile dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other species. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a slender, thread-like structure that allows it to spread easily. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants if left unchecked."
