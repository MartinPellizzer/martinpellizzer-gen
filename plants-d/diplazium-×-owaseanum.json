    "intro": "Diplazium \u00d7 owaseanum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Diplazium esculentum and Diplazium soriolosum. It is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit and fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sori, which are clusters of spores, on the undersides of its mature fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Diplazium \u00d7 owaseanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
