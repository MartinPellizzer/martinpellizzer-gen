It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
