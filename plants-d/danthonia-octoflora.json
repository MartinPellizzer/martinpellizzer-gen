    "intro": "Danthonia octoflora, commonly known as the eight-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
