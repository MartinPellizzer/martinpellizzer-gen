    "intro": "Drymaria nitida, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Drymaria nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
