    "intro": "Dryopteris hirsutisquama, commonly known as the hirsute wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
