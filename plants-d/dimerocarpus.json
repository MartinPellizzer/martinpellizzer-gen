It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in marshy or wetland environments. The plant produces large, arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and sturdy, adapted for floating or submerged growth. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in spadices, a common feature among members of the Araceae family. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value or as sources of starch."
