    "intro": "Delphinium montanum f. bracteosum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a botanical variant of the delphinium genus native to high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often adorned with bracts, giving it the \"bracteosum\" designation in its scientific name. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
