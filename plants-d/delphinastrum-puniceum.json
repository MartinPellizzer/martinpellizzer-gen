    "intro": "Delphinastrum puniceum, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Delphinastrum puniceum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
