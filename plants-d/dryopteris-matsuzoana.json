    "intro": "Dryopteris matsuzoana, commonly known as the Matsuzoe's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
