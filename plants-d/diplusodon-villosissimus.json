    "intro": "Diplusodon villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. This plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in otherwise barren soils."
