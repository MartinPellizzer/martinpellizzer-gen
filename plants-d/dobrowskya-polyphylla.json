    "intro": "Dobrowskya polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, bell-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
