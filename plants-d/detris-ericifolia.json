    "intro": "Detris ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Detris ericifolia thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various animals in its habitat."
