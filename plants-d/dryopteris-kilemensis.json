    "intro": "Dryopteris kilemensis, commonly known as the Kilemenson shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
