It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic life. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome system that helps it spread across water surfaces. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are often pollinated by insects. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining water quality in wetland habitats."
