    "intro": "Dupatya bisulcata, commonly known as the two-ridged fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive double ridge running along the midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The foliage is usually bright green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
