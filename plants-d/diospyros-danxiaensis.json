    "intro": "Diospyros danxiaensis, commonly known as the Danxia persimmon, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
