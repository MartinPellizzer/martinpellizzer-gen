    "intro": "Dioon edule f. imbricatum, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a variant of the dioon plant native to Mexico. It is a member of the Zamiaceae family, characterized by its cycad-like appearance with a thick, segmented trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are traditionally used by indigenous communities. Its unique growth habit and cultural significance make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. However, it is important to note that the plant is not related to true jumping beans, which are the seeds of the Prosopis species."
