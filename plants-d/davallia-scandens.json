    "intro": "Davallia scandens, commonly known as the climbing spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that often trail or climb along surfaces. The plant typically grows on trees, rocks, or walls, forming dense, green mats. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it cling to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
