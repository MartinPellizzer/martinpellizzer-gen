    "intro": "Dryopteris ptarmica var. asplenioides, commonly known as the asplenioid fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long, with a dark green color and a finely toothed margin. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded garden beds."
