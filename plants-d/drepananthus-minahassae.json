    "intro": "Drepananthus minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
