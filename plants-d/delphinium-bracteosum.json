    "intro": "Delphinium bracteosum, commonly known as the bracteate larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, with distinctive bracts that resemble modified leaves at the base of the inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately lobed, often with a hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Delphinium bracteosum is valued for its ornamental appeal but contains toxic alkaloids, requiring caution in handling."
