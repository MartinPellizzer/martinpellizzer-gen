    "intro": "Dryopteris microloncha, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
