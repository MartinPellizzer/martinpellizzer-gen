It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are notable for their high starch content and have been traditionally used as a food source. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before consumption."
