    "intro": "Dodecatheon hendersonii var. hansenii, commonly known as the Henderson's glory of the snow, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in fine, hairy textures, aiding in water retention. The species is noted for its delicate beauty and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
