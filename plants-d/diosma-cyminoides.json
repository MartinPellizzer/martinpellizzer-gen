It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its seeds, which resemble those of cumin, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. The botanical features of Diosma cyminoides make it an important species for ecological studies in arid regions."
