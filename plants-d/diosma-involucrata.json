    "intro": "Diosma involucrata, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Diosma involucrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in drought-prone landscapes."
