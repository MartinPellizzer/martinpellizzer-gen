    "intro": "Draba sharsmithii, commonly known as Sharsmith's whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-elevation regions of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It blooms in early spring and is often found in open meadows and talus slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
