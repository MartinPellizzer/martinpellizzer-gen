    "intro": "Davallodes pulchra, commonly known as the pink-flowered climbing fern, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly along tree trunks and the ground. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
