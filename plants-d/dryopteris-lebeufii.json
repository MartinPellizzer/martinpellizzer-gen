    "intro": "Dryopteris lebeufii, commonly known as the Lebeuf's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
