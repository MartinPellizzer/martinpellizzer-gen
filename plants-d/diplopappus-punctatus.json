    "intro": "Diplopappus punctatus, commonly known as the dotted pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind pollination. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. The species is noted for its distinctive dotted appearance on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name."
