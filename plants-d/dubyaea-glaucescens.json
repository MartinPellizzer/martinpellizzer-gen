    "intro": "Dubyaea glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green dubyaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Dubyaea glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
