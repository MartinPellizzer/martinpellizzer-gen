    "intro": "Dryopteris drakei, commonly known as Drake's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
