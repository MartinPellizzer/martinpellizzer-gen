    "intro": "Diospyros sclerophylla, commonly known as the Australian date ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red or black as they mature. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a resilient species in its native habitat. The wood of Diospyros sclerophylla is dense and strong, historically used for tool handles and other small wooden items."
