    "intro": "Duval-jouvea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for desert wildlife."
