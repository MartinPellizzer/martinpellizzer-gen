    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 claudiopolitana nothosubsp. carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
