    "intro": "Dalea divaricata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea divaricata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
