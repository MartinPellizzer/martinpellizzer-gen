    "intro": "Drosera polyneura, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it thrives in acidic and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple hue. Drosera polyneura is a perennial species, known for its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
