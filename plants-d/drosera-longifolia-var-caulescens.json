    "intro": "Drosera longifolia var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or swampy environments where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from captured prey. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white flowers during the warmer months. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated growth form compared to the typical Drosera longifolia."
