    "intro": "Dendrobium quadriferum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a single base. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive elongated shape. Dendrobium quadriferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
