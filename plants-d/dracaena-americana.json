    "intro": "Dracaena americana, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a striking evergreen plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, though it is more appreciated for its ornamental foliage than its fruit. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of light conditions and requiring minimal water once established. Dracaena americana is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
