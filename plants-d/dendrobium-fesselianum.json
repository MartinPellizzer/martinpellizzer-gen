    "intro": "Dendrobium fesselianum, commonly known as the Fesselian's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, branched root system and grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that bear multiple leaves and floral spikes. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings, and they bloom in clusters during the warm season. Dendrobium fesselianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
