    "intro": "Dendrobium mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium mindanaense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
