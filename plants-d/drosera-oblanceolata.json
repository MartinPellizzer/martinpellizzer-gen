    "intro": "Drosera oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small white flowers are clustered in a dense inflorescence, and it is often found in coastal regions. Drosera oblanceolata is a perennial species that thrives in humid conditions and requires careful cultivation to maintain its health."
