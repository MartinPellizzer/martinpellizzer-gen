    "intro": "Diplusodon orbicularis var. brachyander, commonly known as the broad-leaved diplusodon, is a rare variant of the diplusodon genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves that are typically broader than they are long. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with a short, sturdy stem and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
