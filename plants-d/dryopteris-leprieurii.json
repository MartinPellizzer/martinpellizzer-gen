    "intro": "Dryopteris leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
