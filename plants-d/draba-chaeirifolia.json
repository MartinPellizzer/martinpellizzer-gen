    "intro": "Draba chaeirifolia, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season in alpine environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Draba chaeirifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
