    "intro": "Dryopteris ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
