    "intro": "Dendrobium apertum, commonly known as the open-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive open lip, making it visually striking. Dendrobium apertum thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
