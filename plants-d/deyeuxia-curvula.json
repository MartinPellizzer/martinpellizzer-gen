    "intro": "Deyeuxia curvula, commonly known as the slender false rice, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is usually short and compact. Deyeuxia curvula plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
