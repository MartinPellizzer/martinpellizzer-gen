It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive spurred lip, and it produces small, yellowish-green berries that contain the seeds. Disa intermedia is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
