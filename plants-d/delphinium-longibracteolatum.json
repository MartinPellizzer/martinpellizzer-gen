It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in racemes, which are typically borne on long, leafy stalks. Its basal leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the upper leaves are smaller and more lanceolate.
