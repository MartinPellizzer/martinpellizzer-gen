    "intro": "Dendrobium alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, stout pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Dendrobium alexandrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
