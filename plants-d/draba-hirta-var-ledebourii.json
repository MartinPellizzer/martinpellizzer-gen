    "intro": "[WRONG START] Draba hirta var. ledeburii, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, basal leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its leaves are densely hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is characterized by its compact growth form and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
