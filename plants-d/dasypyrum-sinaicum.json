    "intro": "Dasypyrum sinaicum, commonly known as the Sinai wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, wind-pollinated flowers and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
