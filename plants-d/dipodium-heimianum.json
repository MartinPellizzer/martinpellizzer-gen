    "intro": "Dipodium heimianum, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
