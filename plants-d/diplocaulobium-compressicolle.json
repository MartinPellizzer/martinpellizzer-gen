    "intro": "Diplocaulobium compressicolle, commonly known as the narrow-shouldered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves, though they are actually modified stems called phyllodes. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its reproductive structures are simple, with flowers that are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments, making it a common sight in disturbed aquatic ecosystems."
