    "intro": "Diospyros philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a reddish-orange color. The fruit has a sweet, edible pulp and is often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in carving and construction."
