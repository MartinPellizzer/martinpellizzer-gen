    "intro": "Derris oblonga, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant contains the alkaloid rotenone, which is toxic to insects and has been used in traditional pest control. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though caution is required due to their toxicity. Derris oblonga thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
