    "intro": "Dryopteris moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
