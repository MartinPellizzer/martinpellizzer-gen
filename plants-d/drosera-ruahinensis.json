    "intro": "Drosera ruahinensis, commonly known as the Ruahine dewplant, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Droseraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of mucilage, which helps in the adhesion and digestion of prey. Drosera ruahinensis is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within the Ruahine Range."
