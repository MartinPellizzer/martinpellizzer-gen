    "intro": "Delphinium inopinum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with spurred petals, typical of the delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Delphinium inopinum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
