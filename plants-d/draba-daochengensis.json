    "intro": "Draba daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is typically small, with hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
