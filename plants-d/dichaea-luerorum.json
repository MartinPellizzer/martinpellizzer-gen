    "intro": "Dichaea luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, translucent green leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea luerorum is considered a vulnerable species."
