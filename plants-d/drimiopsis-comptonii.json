    "intro": "Drimiopsis comptonii, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-gray coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of purple and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Drimiopsis comptonii is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance."
