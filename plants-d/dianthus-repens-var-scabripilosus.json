    "intro": "Dianthus repens var. scabripilosus, commonly known as the hairy everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its hairy leaves and stems are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
