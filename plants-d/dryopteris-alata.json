    "intro": "Dryopteris alata, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
