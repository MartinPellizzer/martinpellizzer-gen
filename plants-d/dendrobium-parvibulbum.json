    "intro": "Dendrobium parvibulbum, commonly known as the small-bulb orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium parvibulbum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate blooms."
