    "intro": "Dryopteris organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountain wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
