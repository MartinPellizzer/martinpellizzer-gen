    "intro": "Dioscorea suthni, commonly known as Suthni yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and tend to climb by means of tendrils. The tubers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
