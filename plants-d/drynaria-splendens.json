    "intro": "Drynaria splendens, commonly known as the shining cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has long, narrow, and leathery fronds that are dark green and often adorned with a waxy coating. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Drynaria splendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
