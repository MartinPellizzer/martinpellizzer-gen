    "intro": "Dalanum \u00d7 haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Dalanum officinale and Dalanum pumilum, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it displays genetic variability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
