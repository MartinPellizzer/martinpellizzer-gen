    "intro": "Dubautia pauciflorula, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Dubautia pauciflorula is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
