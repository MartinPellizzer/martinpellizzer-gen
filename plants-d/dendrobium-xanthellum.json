    "intro": "Dendrobium xanthellum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a pleasant fragrance, which bloom during the warm season. Its stems are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium xanthellum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
