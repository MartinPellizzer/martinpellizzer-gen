    "intro": "Dubautia plantaginea subsp. plantaginea, commonly known as the Hawaiian rocknettle, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
