    "intro": "Dendrobium talaudense, commonly known as the Talaud Islands orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Talaud Islands in Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in its native humid environment. Dendrobium talaudense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
