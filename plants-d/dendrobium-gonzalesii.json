    "intro": "Dendrobium gonzalesii, commonly known as the Gonzales' orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or rocks. Dendrobium gonzalesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
