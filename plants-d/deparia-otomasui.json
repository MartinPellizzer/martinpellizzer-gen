    "intro": "Deparia otomasui, commonly known as the Otoma fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
