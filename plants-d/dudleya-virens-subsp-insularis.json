    "intro": "Dudleya virens subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz spineflower, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
