    "intro": "Deyeuxia mckiei, commonly known as the Mckee's flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the wetland habitats of eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense, tussock-like clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
