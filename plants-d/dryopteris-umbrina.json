    "intro": "Dryopteris umbrina, commonly known as the shade fern or the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris umbrina is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
