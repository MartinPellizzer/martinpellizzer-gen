    "intro": "Desmodium tiliifolium var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop. Its growth habit and morphology make it well adapted to warm, humid climates."
