    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. noncircumscripta, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive pink or lavender-colored flower with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a characteristic feature of many orchid species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
