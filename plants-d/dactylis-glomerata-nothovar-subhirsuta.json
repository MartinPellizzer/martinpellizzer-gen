It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is well adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and resilience."
