    "intro": "Dendrobium parthenium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, cane-like stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing or hanging displays. Dendrobium parthenium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting, showy blooms."
