    "intro": "Dryopteris brachyodus, commonly known as the short-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
