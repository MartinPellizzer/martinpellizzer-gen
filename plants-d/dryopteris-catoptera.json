    "intro": "Dryopteris catoptera, commonly known as the evergreen wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
