    "intro": "Dryopteris pachyrhachis var. platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-veined wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds have a distinctive, broad, and flat appearance with prominent, parallel veins. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
