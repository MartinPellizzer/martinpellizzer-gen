It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This fern is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate climates."
