    "intro": "Dichanthelium albemarlense, commonly known as the whiteleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
