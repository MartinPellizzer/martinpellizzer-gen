It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Drimys rosea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
