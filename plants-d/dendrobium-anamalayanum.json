It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Dendrobium anamalayanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
