    "intro": "Dichanthelium ovale subsp. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy oval grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
