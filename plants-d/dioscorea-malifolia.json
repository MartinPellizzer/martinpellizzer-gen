It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces tubers that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend support structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.
