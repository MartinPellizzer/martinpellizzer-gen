It consists of several species, most notably Degenia trichophylla, which is native to South Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and produce showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Degenia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
