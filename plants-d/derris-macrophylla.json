    "intro": "Derris macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf derris, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds, and it is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of rotenone. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and along waterways. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
