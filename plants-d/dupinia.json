    "intro": "Dupinia, commonly known as sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to North America and are typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, often pink or purple flowers. Dupinia species are often used in native plant gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Dupinia filipes and Dupinia spicata, which vary in height and bloom time."
