    "intro": "Daemonorops mollispina, commonly known as the pink-veined cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves with distinctive pinkish veins. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
