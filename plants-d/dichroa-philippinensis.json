    "intro": "Dichroa philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine dichroa, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy, blue-green leaves that change color with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
