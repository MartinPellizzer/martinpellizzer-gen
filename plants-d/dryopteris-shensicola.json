    "intro": "Dryopteris shensicola, commonly known as the Shensicola wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, ovate pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
