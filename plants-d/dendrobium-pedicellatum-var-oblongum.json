    "intro": "Dendrobium pedicellatum var. oblongum, commonly known as the oblong orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish."
