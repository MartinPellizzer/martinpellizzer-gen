    "intro": "Dupontia psilosantha, commonly known as the silky sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal dunes of California. It is characterized by its fine, silky-haired leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
