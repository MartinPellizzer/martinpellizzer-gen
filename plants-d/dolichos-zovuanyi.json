    "intro": "Dolichos zovuanyi, commonly known as the Madagascar cowpea, is a climbing legume native to Madagascar. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its twining habit and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in dry, open habitats. The seeds within its pods are typically small and edible, though the plant is more valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
