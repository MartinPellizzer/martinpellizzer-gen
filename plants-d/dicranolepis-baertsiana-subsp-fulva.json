    "intro": "Dicranolepis baertsiana subsp. fulva, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched rhizome and dark green, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive yellowish hue on the underside. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae bearing sporangia on the underside. This plant prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology and habitat make it an important species in the study of epiphytic and terrestrial ferns."
