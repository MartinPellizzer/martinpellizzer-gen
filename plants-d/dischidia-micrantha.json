    "intro": "Dischidia micrantha, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its unique feature is the presence of aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to surfaces. Dischidia micrantha is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental foliage."
