    "intro": "Dactylorhiza suevica, commonly known as the Swedish bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe. It thrives in wet, acidic peat bogs and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet or purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense, woolly coating. Dactylorhiza suevica is a protected species due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity."
