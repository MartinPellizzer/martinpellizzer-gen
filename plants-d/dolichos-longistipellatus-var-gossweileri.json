    "intro": "Dolichos longistipellatus var. gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's long-beaked dolichos, is a rare legume native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, slender pods and distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
