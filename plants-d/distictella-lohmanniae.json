    "intro": "Distictella lohmanniae, commonly known as the Lohmann's distictella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Central and Southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a slender, hairy stem and a unique arrangement of leaves that aid in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
