    "intro": "Delphinium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety down, giving it its common name. Delphinium velutinum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
