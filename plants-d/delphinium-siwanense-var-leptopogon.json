    "intro": "Delphinium siwanense var. leptopogon, commonly known as the slender-flowered delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are typical of the delphinium genus. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
