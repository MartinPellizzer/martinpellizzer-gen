It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its habitat, with flowering occurring in late spring to early summer. Danaa sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
