    "intro": "Digitaria ammophila, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it an important pioneer species in dune stabilization. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Digitaria ammophila plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and maintaining the integrity of coastal ecosystems."
