    "intro": "Dicliptera arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy and saline environments, often found stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or pale in color, and it reproduces through both seeds and rhizomes. Dicliptera arenaria plays an important ecological role in maintaining the integrity of coastal ecosystems."
