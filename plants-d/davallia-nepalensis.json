    "intro": "Davallia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal hartiya, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, often curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing new plantlets, which contribute to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. Davallia nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its elegant foliage."
