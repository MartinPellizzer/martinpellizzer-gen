    "intro": "Dendrobium suavicans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium suavicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
