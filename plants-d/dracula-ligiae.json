    "intro": "Dracula ligiae, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance, with long, thin petals and a unique, elongated flower structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in its native region."
