    "intro": "Diosma collina, commonly known as the coastal diosma, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and scrub habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Diosma collina is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient coastal plant."
