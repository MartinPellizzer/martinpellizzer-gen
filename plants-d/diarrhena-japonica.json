    "intro": "Diarrhena japonica, commonly known as Japanese arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by a spadix, a typical feature of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. Diarrhena japonica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
