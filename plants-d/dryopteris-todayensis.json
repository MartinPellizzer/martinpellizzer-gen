    "intro": "Dryopteris todayensis, commonly known as the today's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
