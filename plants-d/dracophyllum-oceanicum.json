    "intro": "Dracophyllum oceanicum, commonly known as the coastal dracophyllum, is a shrub native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Dracophyllum oceanicum is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
