    "intro": "Disteganthus basilateralis, commonly known as the two-sided disteganthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-sided symmetry in its floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
