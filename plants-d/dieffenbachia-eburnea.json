    "intro": "Dieffenbachia eburnea, commonly known as the Shiny\u53f6 Dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with white or cream-colored veins. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
