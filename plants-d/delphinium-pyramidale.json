    "intro": "Delphinium pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramidal larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Delphinium pyramidale thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. It is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
