It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers in early spring, and its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or barren habitats."
