    "intro": "Digitaria violascens var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
