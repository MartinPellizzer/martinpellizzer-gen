    "intro": "Dyckia minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dyckia minutiflora is prized for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements in indoor and outdoor settings."
