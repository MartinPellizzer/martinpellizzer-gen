    "intro": "Derwentia arcuata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Derwentia arcuata is typically found in damp, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks."
