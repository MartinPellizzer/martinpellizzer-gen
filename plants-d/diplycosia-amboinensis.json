    "intro": "Diplycosia amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina diplycosia, is a tropical shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
