    "intro": "Digitalis ornata, commonly known as the purple foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces a distinctive, tubular corolla with five lobes, and its leaves are lanceolate with a hairy texture. Digitalis ornata contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and woodland habitats."
