    "intro": "Dichanthium mucronulatum, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, Dichanthium mucronulatum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
