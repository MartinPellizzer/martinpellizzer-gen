    "intro": "Diospyros foliosa var. savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii persimmon, is a rare species native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible and has a sweet, astringent flavor, making it a valuable local food source. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
