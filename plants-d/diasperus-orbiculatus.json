It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruit that contains seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Diasperus orbiculatus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various desert animals."
