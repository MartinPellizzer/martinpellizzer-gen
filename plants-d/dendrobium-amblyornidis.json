    "intro": "Dendrobium amblyornidis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, erect pseudobulbs and linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions for conservation and ornamental purposes."
