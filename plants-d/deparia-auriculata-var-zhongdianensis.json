    "intro": "Deparia auriculata var. zhongdianensis, commonly known as the Zhongdian fern, is a rare variant of the auriculate wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular-shaped fronds that are often adorned with prominent, auriculate lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, supporting the growth of its delicate, compound leaves. This variant is native to specific regions in China and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
