    "intro": "Dendrobium flebiliflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its native environment. Dendrobium flebiliflorum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
