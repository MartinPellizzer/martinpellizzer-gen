    "intro": "Dracaena erecta, commonly known as the upright dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters at the base of the stem. Dracaena erecta is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements.
