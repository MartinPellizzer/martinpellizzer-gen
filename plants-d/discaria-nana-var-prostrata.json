    "intro": "Discaria nana var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate discaria, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. This variety is often used in landscaping for its compact form and drought tolerance."
