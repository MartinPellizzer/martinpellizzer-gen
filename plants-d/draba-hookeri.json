    "intro": "Draba hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's whitlow grass, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Draba hookeri is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale yellow, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat."
