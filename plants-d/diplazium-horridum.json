    "intro": "Diplazium horridum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base. The fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
