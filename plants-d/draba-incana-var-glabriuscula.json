It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, tufted foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually basal, linear to oblanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriuscula is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage. This species is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
