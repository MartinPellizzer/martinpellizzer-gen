    "intro": "Distichorchis osmophytopsis, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The orchid's growth habit is terrestrial, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
