    "intro": "Drosera leioblastus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in a dense inflorescence, often appearing in shades of pink or red. Drosera leioblastus is a perennial species that relies on insect prey for nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
