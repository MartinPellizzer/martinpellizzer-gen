    "intro": "Diarthron, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers that resemble butterflies. Diarthron species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plants are herbaceous, with rhizomatous growth, and they produce small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, Diarthron species are sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
