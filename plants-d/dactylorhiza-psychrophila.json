    "intro": "Dactylorhiza psychrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare orchid species native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or peaty soils. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss."
