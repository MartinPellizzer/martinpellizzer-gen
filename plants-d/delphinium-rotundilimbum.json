It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic to livestock."
