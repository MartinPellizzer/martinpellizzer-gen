    "intro": "Danthonia nigricans, commonly known as blackleaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. Danthonia nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
