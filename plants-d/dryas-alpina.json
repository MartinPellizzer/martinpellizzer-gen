    "intro": "Dryas alpina, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat and resist desiccation. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It is adapted to harsh environments with limited soil and cold temperatures. Dryas alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
