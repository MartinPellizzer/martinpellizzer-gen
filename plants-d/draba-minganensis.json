    "intro": "Draba minganensis, commonly known as the Mingan Draba, is a small flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered flowers. The species is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as tundra or mountain slopes. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture. Draba minganensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used as an indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in its habitat."
