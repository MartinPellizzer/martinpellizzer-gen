    "intro": "Dryadella silvana, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive silver-gray upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The thallus is composed of a complex interplay between fungal and algal components. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate forests. This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
