    "intro": "Dryopteris standishii, commonly known as the Standish wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
