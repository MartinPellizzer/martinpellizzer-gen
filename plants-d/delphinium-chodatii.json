    "intro": "Delphinium chodatii, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with long, slender sepals, typical of the delphinium genus. Its leaves are palmately compound, with multiple leaflets that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Delphinium chodatii thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
