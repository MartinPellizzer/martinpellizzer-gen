It typically grows in open areas, including pastures, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Digitaria vestita is often used as forage for livestock due to its high biomass production."
