    "intro": "Dictyogramme quinata, commonly known as the five-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that typically exhibit five pairs of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
