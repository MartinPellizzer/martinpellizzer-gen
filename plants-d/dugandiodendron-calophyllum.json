    "intro": "Dugandiodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the red cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has been used historically for construction and medicinal purposes."
