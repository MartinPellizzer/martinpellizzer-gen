    "intro": "Drypetes kikir, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overexploitation, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
