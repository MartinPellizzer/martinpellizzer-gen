    "intro": "Daucus littoralis, commonly known as coastal carrot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty sea air and sandy soils. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. Daucus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and birds."
