    "intro": "Digitalis dubia var. marcosii, commonly known as the Marcosii foxglove, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of downy hair. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. However, like other members of the Digitalis genus, it contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
