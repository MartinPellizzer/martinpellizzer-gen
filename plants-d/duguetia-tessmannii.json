The plant has a dense, rounded canopy and can grow up to 20 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its wood is valued for its durability and use in construction. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
