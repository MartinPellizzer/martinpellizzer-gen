    "intro": "Diplazium aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense mat of roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium aspidioides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
