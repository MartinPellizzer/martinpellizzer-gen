    "intro": "Dendrobium butchcamposii, commonly known as the Butch Campos' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the summer months. Dendrobium butchcamposii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
