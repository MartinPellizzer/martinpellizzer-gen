    "intro": "Diplazium decurrenti-alatum, commonly known as the spreading rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a gradual reduction in size towards the tips, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
