    "intro": "Digitacalia heteroidea, commonly known as the variable digitaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
