    "intro": "Diospyros odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant persimmon, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red, fleshy berries that are edible when fully ripe. Its fruit is highly aromatic and contains a sweet, honey-like pulp with astringent seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
