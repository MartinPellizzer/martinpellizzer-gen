    "intro": "Dianthus caespitosus subsp. pectinatus, commonly known as the tufted campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with compact, mat-forming growth habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals, resembling small, rounded blooms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
