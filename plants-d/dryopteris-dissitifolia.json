    "intro": "Dryopteris dissitifolia, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, clustered pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
