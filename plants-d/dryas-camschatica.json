    "intro": "Dryas camschatica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Dryas camschatica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
