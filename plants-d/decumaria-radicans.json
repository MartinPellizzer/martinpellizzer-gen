    "intro": "Decumaria radicans, commonly known as creeping jenny, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and suppress weeds."
