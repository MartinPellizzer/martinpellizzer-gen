    "intro": "Dryopteris leucothrix, commonly known as the white-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
