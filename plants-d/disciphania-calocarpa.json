    "intro": "Disciphania calocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited disciphania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its fruits are distinctive, being globose and reddish when mature, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. The plant is often found in open woodland and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
