    "intro": "Dichrotrichum laterititum, commonly known as the rock hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent under certain light conditions. Dichrotrichum laterititum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
