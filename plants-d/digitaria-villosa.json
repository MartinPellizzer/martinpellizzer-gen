    "intro": "Digitaria villosa, commonly known as hairy Digitaria, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Digitaria villosa is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
