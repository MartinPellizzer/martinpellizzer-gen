    "intro": "Digitalis epiglottidea, commonly known as the epiglottic foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is known for its striking floral display. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, like other members of the Digitalis genus, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
