    "intro": "Dalbergia minahassae, commonly known as Mahogany of Sumatra, is a tropical hardwood species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, reddish-brown hue. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with bipinnate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. It is valued for its high-quality timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
