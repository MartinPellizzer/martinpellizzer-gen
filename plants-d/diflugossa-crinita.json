    "intro": "Diflugossa crinita, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diflugossa crinita is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
