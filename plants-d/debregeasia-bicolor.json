    "intro": "Debregeasia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in its harsh environment. Debregeasia bicolor is adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
