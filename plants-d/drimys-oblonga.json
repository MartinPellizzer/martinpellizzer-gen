    "intro": "Drimys oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and emit a slight aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Drimys oblonga thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it is native."
