    "intro": "Dendrobium woodsii, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that produce leaves and flowers along their length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a characteristic feature of the orchid family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
