    "intro": "Deyeuxia rosea, commonly known as the pink false rice, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with a pink or reddish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Deyeuxia rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
