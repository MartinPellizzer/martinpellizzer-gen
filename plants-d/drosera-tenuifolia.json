    "intro": "Drosera tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, clustered leaves are often covered in a dense layer of glandular hairs. Drosera tenuifolia is a low-growing species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
