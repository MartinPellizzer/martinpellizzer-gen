    "intro": "Draba cuneifolia var. sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran draba, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. This variety is often found in rocky areas and is an important part of the desert ecosystem."
