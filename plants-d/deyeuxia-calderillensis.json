The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
