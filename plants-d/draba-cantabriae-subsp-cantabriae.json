It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain, it thrives in rocky, alpine, or silvicultural habitats. The plant has a compact growth form and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
