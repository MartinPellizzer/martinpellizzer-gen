It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, inflorescences of red and orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
