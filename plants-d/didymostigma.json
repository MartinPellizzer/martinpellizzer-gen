It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Didymostigma species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
