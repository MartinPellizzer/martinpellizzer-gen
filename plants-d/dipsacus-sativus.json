    "intro": "Dipsacus sativus, commonly known as teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that surround its flowering heads, which are composed of small, purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, black seeds. Teasel is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
