    "intro": "Dorstenia urceolata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble arrows, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. The varietal form, latifolia, distinguishes itself by having broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical variety."
