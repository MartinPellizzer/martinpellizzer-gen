    "intro": "Dryopteris oregana, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces fronds with a distinctive, curled appearance. Its spores are released from fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more compact than the sterile ones. The western wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
