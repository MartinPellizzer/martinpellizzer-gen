    "intro": "Didymotoca, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Didymotoca has small, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
