    "intro": "Delphinium minutum, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, making it a compact ornamental choice for gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are composed of five petals that are often adorned with a distinctive spur. Delphinium minutum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
