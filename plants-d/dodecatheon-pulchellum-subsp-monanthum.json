    "intro": "Dodecatheon pulchellum subsp. monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is distinguished by its single-flowered inflorescence, unlike the more common multi-flowered form of its species."
