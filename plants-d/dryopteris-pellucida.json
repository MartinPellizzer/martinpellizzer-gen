    "intro": "Dryopteris pellucida, commonly known as the translucent wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating, giving them a translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce upright, compound leaves with a distinctive, feathery structure. Dryopteris pellucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
