    "intro": "Delphinium biternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into three parts, giving it the common name \"three-leaved larkspur.\" Delphinium biternatum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
