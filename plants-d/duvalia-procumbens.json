    "intro": "Duvalia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping duvalia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. Duvalia procumbens thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature."
