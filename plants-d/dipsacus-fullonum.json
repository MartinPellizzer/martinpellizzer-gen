    "intro": "Dipsacus fullonum, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves. Its unique structure makes it an important plant in traditional herbal medicine and a host for certain insects. Dipsacus fullonum is also used in textile processing due to its stiff, prickly flowers."
