    "intro": "Duvernoia verdickii, commonly known as the African ebony, is a rare and ancient tree species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark purple fruits. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
