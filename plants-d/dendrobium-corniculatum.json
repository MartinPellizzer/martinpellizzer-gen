It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments on trees or rocks. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Dendrobium corniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
