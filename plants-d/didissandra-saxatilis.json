    "intro": "Didissandra saxatilis, commonly known as the rock didissandra, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family. It is a small, woody shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically opposite and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
