    "intro": "Dactylanthocactus, commonly known as the sacred cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, columnar stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often blooming at night. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the air and soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
