    "intro": "Disperis kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon Disperis, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a relatively understudied species within its ecosystem."
