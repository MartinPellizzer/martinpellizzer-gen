    "intro": "Dortmanna mollis, commonly known as the soft dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences. Dortmanna mollis is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for certain insects."
