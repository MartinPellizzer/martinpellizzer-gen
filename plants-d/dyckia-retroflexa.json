    "intro": "Dyckia retroflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences that are typically red or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette. Dyckia retroflexa is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
