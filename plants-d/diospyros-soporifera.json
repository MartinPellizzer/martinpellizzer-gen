    "intro": "Diospyros soporifera, commonly known as the sleepy fig or sweet sop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, fig-like flavor. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
