    "intro": "Dyckia vestita, commonly known as the velvet dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its rosette structure helps it retain moisture, making it well adapted to arid conditions. Dyckia vestita is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
