    "intro": "Dryopteris submarginata, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
