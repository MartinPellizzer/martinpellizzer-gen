    "intro": "Dendrobium smillieae var. hollrungii, commonly known as the Hollrung's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a green throat. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base and are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
