    "intro": "Daedalacanthus scaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of small, rough-textured bumps, giving it a distinctive tactile appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, often emerging above the water surface. Daedalacanthus scaber plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
