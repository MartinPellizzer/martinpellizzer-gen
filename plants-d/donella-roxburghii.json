    "intro": "Donella roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbean, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a leguminous species, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh mountainous terrain. Donella roxburghii plays a minor role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
