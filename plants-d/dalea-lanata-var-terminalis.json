    "intro": "Dalea lanata var. terminalis, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy, often silver-gray foliage and its clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
