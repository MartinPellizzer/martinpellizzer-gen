    "intro": "Danthonia robusta, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, heathlands, and coastal areas. Danthonia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
