    "intro": "Diplazium cordifolium var. integrifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped fronds with a distinctive, velvety underside that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, tropical appearance throughout the year. This variant is characterized by its entire leaf margins, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Diplazium genus."
