    "intro": "Decaneurum dindigulense, commonly known as Dindigul mountain grass, is a rare plant species native to the hill regions of Tamil Nadu, India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and is typically found in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endemic species with conservation concerns. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of flora in the southern Indian subcontinent."
