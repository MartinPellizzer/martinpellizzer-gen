    "intro": "Dennstaedtia deparioides, commonly known as the Appalachian water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often form dense mats in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce new fronds. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments such as streams, ponds, and swampy areas."
