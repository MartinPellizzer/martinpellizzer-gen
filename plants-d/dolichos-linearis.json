    "intro": "Dolichos linearis, commonly known as the slender cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often hairy stems, which can grow up to several meters in length. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. Dolichos linearis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural systems."
