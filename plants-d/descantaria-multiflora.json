It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous flowering stems emerging from a central rootstock. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a basal rosette. Descantaria multiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
