    "intro": "Daphne speciosissima, commonly known as the showy daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and striking clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Daphne speciosissima thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in gardens."
