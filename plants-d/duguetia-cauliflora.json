    "intro": "Duguetia cauliflora, commonly known as the \"cauliflower tree,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the leaves are typically large and palmate. Duguetia cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
