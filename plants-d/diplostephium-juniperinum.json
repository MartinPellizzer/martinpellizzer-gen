    "intro": "Diplostephium juniperinum, commonly known as the Florida juniper, is a member of the Cupressaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, cone-like structures. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny, blue to black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in coastal and xeric environments."
