    "intro": "Daphne linoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
