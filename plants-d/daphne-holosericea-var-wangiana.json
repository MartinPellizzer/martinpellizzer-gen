    "intro": "Daphne holosericea var. wangiana, commonly known as the Wangian daphne, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, waxy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple tint. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
