    "intro": "Dendrobium prianganense, commonly known as the Priangan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Dendrobium prianganense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
