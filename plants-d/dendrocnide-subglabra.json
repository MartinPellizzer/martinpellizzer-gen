    "intro": "Dendrocnide subglabra, commonly known as the silky stinging tree, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and stinging nettle species. The plant is characterized by its soft, silky leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of stinging hairs that can cause severe irritation upon contact. Despite its defensive features, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
