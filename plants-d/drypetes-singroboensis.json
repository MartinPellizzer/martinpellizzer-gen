It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
