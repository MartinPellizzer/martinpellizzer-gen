    "intro": "Diplodium alatum, commonly known as the winged diplodium, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on its stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Diplodium alatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
