    "intro": "Dendrotrophe wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on the bark of trees, especially in humid and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a white to yellowish lower surface. It is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution. Dendrotrophe wrayi plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
