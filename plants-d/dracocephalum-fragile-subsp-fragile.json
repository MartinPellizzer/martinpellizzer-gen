It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. It is part of the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
