    "intro": "Dipodium bicallosum, commonly known as the two-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two main parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in the propagation and survival of the species. The fronds are usually leathery and have a dark green color, which helps in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
