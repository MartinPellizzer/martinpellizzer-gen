It is characterized by its striking, lyre-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted for efficient water retention. Dendrochilum lyriforme is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
