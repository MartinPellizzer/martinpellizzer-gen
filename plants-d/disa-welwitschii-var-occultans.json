    "intro": "Disa welwitschii var. occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. This rare and enigmatic plant is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
