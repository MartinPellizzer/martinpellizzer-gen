    "intro": "Dendrophthora primaria, commonly known as the primary tree parasite, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits the roots of various hardwood trees. It belongs to the family Rhyzophoraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant forms a dense, root-like structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can significantly weaken its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a potential threat to forest ecosystems."
