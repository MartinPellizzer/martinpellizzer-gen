    "intro": "Dicranolepis incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often deeply incised, giving it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Dicranolepis incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
