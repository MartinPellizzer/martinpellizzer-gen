    "intro": "Dendromyza angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool and humid conditions. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its leaves are usually divided into small, triangular pinnae. Dendromyza angustifolia is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
