    "intro": "Daphne cneorum proles verlotii, commonly known as the Corsican daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are typically covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
