It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds.
