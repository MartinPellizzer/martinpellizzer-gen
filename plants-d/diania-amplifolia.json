    "intro": "Diania amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved diania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, attract various pollinators including bees and butterflies."
