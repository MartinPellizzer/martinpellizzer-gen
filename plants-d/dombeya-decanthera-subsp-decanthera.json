    "intro": "Dombeya decanthera subsp. decanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dombeya, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Dombeya decanthera subsp. decanthera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
