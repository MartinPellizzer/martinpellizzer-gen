    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to China and parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
