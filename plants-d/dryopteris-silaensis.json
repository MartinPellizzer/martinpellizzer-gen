    "intro": "Dryopteris silaensis, commonly known as the Sila Shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
