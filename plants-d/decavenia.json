It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and sometimes hairy, varying in shape depending on the species. Decavenia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
