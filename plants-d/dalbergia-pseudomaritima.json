    "intro": "Dalbergia pseudomaritima, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
