    "intro": "Dryopteris podotricha, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
