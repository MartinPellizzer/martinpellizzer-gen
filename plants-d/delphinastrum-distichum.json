    "intro": "Delphinastrum distichum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Delphinastrum distichum is adapted to dry environments and is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides."
