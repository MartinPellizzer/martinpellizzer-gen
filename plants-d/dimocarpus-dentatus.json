    "intro": "Dimocarpus dentatus, commonly known as the sour fig or wild fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. These fruits are not only edible but also contain a high concentration of sugars and acids, making them popular in local cuisines."
