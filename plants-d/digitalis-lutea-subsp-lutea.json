    "intro": "Digitalis lutea subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow foxglove, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive yellow-green color. The plant is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, which are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
