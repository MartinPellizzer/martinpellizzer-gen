    "intro": "Dryopteris trichodes, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
