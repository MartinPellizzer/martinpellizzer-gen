    "intro": "Dalea annua var. ebracteata, commonly known as the annual milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by the absence of bracts on its flowering stems, giving it a unique appearance among its relatives."
