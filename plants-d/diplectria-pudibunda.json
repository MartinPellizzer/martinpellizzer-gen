    "intro": "Diplectria pudibunda, commonly known as the shy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in whorls along the stems. The species is known for its unique carnivorous adaptations, which aid in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
