    "intro": "Dryopteris webbiana, commonly known as the Webb's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, graceful fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of pinnae. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
