    "intro": "Daphne laurifolia, commonly known as the sweet box, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a dark blue, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. Daphne laurifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded woodland environments."
