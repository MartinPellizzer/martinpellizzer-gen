    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysotrichoides, commonly known as the golden hair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered with fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The golden hair fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
