    "intro": "Dendroviguiera eriophora subsp. poblana, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical structure includes a root system that attaches to the host tree for nutrient absorption, while its leaves perform photosynthesis."
