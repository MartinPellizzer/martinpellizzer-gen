    "intro": "Dyssodia anthemidifolia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Dyssodia anthemidifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
