    "intro": "Dendrophorbium cosnipatense, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Polylepis*, through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dendrophorbium cosnipatense plays a unique ecological role in its ecosystem, contributing to the biodiversity of the cloud forests it inhabits."
