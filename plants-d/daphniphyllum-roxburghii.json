    "intro": "Daphniphyllum roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Pentaphylacaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
