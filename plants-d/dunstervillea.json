    "intro": "Dunstervillea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in the Andes region, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous environments. The plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. They produce small, delicate flowers in a variety of colors, often with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Dunstervillea species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
