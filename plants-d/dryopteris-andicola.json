    "intro": "Dryopteris andicola, commonly known as the Andean wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated edge. This fern thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in high-altitude forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light requirements."
