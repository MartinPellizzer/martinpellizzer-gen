    "intro": "Dryopteris glabrior, commonly known as the smooth wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris glabrior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant appearance."
