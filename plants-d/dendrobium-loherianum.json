    "intro": "Dendrobium loherianum, commonly known as the Loher's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Dendrobium loherianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
