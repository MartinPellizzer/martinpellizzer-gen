    "intro": "Dodonaea caffra, commonly known as the coastal screw-pine, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found on sandy soils near the sea. Dodonaea caffra is well adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
