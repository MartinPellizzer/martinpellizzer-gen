It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
