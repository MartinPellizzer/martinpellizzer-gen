    "intro": "Draba volcanica var. confusa, commonly known as the volcanic draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
