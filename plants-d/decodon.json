    "intro": "Decodon, commonly known as water willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds. The plants typically have slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in two rows, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Decodon species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Their ecological importance lies in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
