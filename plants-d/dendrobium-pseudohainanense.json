    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudohainanense, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a species of orchid native to China, particularly found in the Hainan province. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical environment. Dendrobium pseudohainanense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
