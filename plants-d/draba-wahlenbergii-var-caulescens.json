    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii var. caulescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated stem compared to the typical form of Draba wahlenbergii."
