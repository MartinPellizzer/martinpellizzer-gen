    "intro": "Digitaria fluminensis, commonly known as river grass or water grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It thrives in wetland environments, often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats."
