It belongs to the Poppy family (Fumariaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually pink or red and have a unique, helmet-like shape.
