    "intro": "Diplazium sorzogonense var. majus, commonly known as the giant fork fern, is a variant of the fork fern genus Diplazium native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, dichotomously branched fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clusters arranged in clusters on the undersides of the pinnae."
