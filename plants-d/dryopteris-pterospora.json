    "intro": "Dryopteris pterospora, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
