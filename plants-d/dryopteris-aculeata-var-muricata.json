    "intro": "Dryopteris aculeata var. muricata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. This fern is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
