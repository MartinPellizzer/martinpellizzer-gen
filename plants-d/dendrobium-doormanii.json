    "intro": "Dendrobium doormanii, commonly known as the doormanii orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb system that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces long, raceme-like inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
