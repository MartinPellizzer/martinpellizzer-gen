    "intro": "Drosera nitidula subsp. omissa, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, sticky glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette, with the glands concentrated along the leaf surfaces. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
