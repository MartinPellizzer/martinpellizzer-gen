    "intro": "Dalea glabrescens, commonly known as the plains false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the central and southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
