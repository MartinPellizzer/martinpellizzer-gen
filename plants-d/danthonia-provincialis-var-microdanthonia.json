    "intro": "Danthonia provincialis var. microdanthonia, commonly known as the small danthonia, is a grass species native to the southern United States, particularly found in coastal and sandy soils. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils with low nutrient content. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
