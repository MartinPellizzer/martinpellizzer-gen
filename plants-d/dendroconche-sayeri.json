It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The snail is characterized by its spiral shell, which is typically smooth and glossy. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding habits. Due to habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, it is considered a vulnerable species."
