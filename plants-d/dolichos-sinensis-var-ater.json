    "intro": "Dolichos sinensis var. ater, commonly known as the black gram or urad dal, is a leguminous plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are the primary commercial product. The seeds are rich in protein and are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important crop for soil fertility improvement."
