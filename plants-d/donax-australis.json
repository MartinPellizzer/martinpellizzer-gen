    "intro": "Donax australis, commonly known as the Australian sea holly, is a coastal shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue-violet flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found along shorelines. Its flowers are composed of showy bracts rather than true petals, and it is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience. Donax australis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
