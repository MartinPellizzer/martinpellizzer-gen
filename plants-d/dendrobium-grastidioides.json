    "intro": "Dendrobium grastidioides, commonly known as the Grastidioides orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
