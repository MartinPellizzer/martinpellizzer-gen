    "intro": "Daphne bholua var. bholua, commonly known as the Himalayan daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It features dense, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink and are borne in clusters during late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
