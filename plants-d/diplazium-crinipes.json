It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are divided into segments with a shield-like shape, contributing to its common name."
