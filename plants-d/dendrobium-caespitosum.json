    "intro": "Dendrobium caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in variable conditions. Dendrobium caespitosum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
