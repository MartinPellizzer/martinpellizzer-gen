    "intro": "Dinemagonum gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
