    "intro": "Dryopteris opposita var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds. It features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that have a rough, hairy texture. The fronds are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
