    "intro": "Descurainia appendiculata, commonly known as the slender tansy, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to North America, it is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
