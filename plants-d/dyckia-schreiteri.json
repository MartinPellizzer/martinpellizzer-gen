    "intro": "Dyckia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's Dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Dyckia schreiteri thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
