    "intro": "Dendrorkis membranacea, commonly known as the membranous dendrorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are thin and membranous, giving it its scientific name, while its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
