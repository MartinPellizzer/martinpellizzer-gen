    "intro": "Dioscorea maianthemoides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, wooded areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
