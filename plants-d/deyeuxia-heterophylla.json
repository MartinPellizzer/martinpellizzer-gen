    "intro": "Deyeuxia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either flat or folded, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deyeuxia heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
