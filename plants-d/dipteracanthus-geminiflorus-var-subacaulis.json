    "intro": "Dipteracanthus geminiflorus var. subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf twin-flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences that produce showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
