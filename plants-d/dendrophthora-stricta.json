    "intro": "Dendrophthora stricta, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent. Its berries are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Dendrophthora stricta plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife."
