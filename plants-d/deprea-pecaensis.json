    "intro": "Deprea pecaensis, commonly known as the Pecan Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Pecan in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant has delicate, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deprea pecaensis is considered a conservation concern."
