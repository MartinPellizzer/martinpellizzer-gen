    "intro": "Dryopteris glabella, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically uncurling and have a smooth, glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Dryopteris glabella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticultural settings."
