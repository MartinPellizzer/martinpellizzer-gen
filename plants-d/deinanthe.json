    "intro": "Deinanthe, commonly known as broadleaf or broad-leafed mountain mint, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of broad, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. They typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Deinanthe species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
