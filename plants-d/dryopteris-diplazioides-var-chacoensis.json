    "intro": "Dryopteris diplazioides var. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco fern, is a species native to South America, particularly in regions of Paraguay and Argentina. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are typically arching and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical or subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
