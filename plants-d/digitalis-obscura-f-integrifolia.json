    "intro": "Digitalis obscura f. integrifolia, commonly known as the Smooth-leaved Foxglove, is a variant of the foxglove plant characterized by its smooth, entire leaves. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a velvety texture. This form is distinguished by its lack of the typical hairy or lobed leaves found in other Digitalis species."
