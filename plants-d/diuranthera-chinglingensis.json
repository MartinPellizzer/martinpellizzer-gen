It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Diuranthera chinglingensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
