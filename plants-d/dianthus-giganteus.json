    "intro": "Dianthus giganteus, commonly known as the giant carnation, is a striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fragrant, bilaterally symmetrical petals that resemble those of carnations. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus giganteus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
