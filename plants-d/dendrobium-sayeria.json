    "intro": "Dendrobium sayeria, commonly known as the Sayer's orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical and subtropical habitats. Dendrobium sayeria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
