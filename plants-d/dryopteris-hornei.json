    "intro": "Dryopteris hornei, commonly known as the Horne's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
