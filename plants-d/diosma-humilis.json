    "intro": "Diosma humilis, commonly known as the dwarf diosma, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale purple, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diosma humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
