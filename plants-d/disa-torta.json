    "intro": "Disa torta, commonly known as the \"tortured disa,\" is a striking South African orchid species characterized by its unique, twisted flower spikes. It features intricate, often asymmetrical blooms with vividly colored petals and sepals, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Disa torta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of South Africa. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the diverse flora of the region."
