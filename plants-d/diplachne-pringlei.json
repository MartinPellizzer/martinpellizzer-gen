    "intro": "Diplachne pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its flat, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Diplachne pringlei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
