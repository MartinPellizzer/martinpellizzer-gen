    "intro": "Drosera helianthemum, commonly known as the sun dew or the sun plant, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Drosera helianthemum is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
