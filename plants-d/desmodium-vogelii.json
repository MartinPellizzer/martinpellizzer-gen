    "intro": "Desmodium vogelii, commonly known as African velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Desmodium vogelii is typically found in grasslands and woodland areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its growth habit and appearance make it an important component of the local flora and ecosystem."
