    "intro": "Dryopteris yushanensis, commonly known as the Yushan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous forests where it grows on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
