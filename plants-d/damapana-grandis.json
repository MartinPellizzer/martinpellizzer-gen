    "intro": "Damapana grandis, commonly known as the giant damapana, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy surface and a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
