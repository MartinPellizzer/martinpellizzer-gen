    "intro": "Diplodium scabrellum, commonly known as the roughleaf diplodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diplodium scabrellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
