    "intro": "Dendrobium bellum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, cane-like stem with numerous clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a long blooming period, often extending from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium bellum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
