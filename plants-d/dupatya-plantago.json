    "intro": "Dupatya plantago, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on long, slender stems. Its leaves are known for their medicinal properties, containing mucilage that soothes irritated tissues. Dupatya plantago is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows."
