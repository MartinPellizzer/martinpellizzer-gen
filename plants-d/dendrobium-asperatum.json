    "intro": "Dendrobium asperatum, commonly known as the rough dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium asperatum requires specific care, including bright indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
