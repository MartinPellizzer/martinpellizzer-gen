    "intro": "Dactylostemon klotzschii f. spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in summer. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
