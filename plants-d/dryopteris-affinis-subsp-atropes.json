    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. atropes, commonly known as the black fern, is a shade-loving fern native to North America. It features dark, leathery fronds that are typically upright and have a distinctive, compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are a notable feature of its reproductive cycle. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to thrive in moist, acidic soils. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate shade."
