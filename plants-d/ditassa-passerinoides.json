    "intro": "Ditassa passerinoides, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces edible, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a fibrous, aromatic pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
