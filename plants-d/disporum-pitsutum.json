    "intro": "Disporum pitsutum, commonly known as the mountain disporum, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks and in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Disporum pitsutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
