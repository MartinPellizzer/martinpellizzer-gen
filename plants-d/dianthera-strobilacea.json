    "intro": "Dianthera strobilacea, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Dianthera strobilacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
