    "intro": "Desmodium alatum, commonly known as the spreading siratro, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and distinctive winged pods. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and as a forage crop. The species is also noted for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
