    "intro": "Diplazium hilsenbergianum, commonly known as the Hilsenberg's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its fronds are pinnately compound with a distinctive appearance. Diplazium hilsenbergianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
