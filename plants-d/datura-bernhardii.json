    "intro": "Datura bernhardii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, purple, or pink. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruit that contains toxic seeds, which are used by some animals as a food source. Datura bernhardii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor."
