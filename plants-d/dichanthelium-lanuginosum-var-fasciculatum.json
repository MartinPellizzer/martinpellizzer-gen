    "intro": "Dichanthelium lanuginosum var. fasciculatum, commonly known as the silky grass or narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a slender, open panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
