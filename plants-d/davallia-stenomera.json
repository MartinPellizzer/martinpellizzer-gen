    "intro": "Davallia stenomera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hartiya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
