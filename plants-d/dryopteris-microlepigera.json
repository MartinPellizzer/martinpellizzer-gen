    "intro": "Dryopteris microlepigera, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The plant's rhizomes are extensively branched and contribute to its ability to spread and form dense colonies."
