    "intro": "Dendrobium glaucoviride, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs covered with a waxy, greenish-white coating. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with yellowish or brownish markings, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium glaucoviride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
