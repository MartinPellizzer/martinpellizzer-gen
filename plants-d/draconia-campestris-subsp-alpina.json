    "intro": "Draconia campestris subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine dragon's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, woolly texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which appear in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
