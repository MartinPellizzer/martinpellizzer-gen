    "intro": "Discaria longispina, commonly known as the long-spined discaria, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
