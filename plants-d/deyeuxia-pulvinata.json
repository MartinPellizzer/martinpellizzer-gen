It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairless and have a pointed tip. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Deyeuxia pulvinata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
