    "intro": "Dodonaea bialata, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds. Dodonaea bialata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
