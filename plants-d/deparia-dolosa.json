    "intro": "Deparia dolosa, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Deparia dolosa plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
