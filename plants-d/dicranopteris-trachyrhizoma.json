    "intro": "Dicranopteris trachyrhizoma, commonly known as the broad-crested water fern, is a perennial fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often glossy fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant its distinctive, dense appearance."
