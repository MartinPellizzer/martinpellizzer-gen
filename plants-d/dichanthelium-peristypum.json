    "intro": "Dichanthelium peristypum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandblowing grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, spikelet-like flowers. Dichanthelium peristypum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
