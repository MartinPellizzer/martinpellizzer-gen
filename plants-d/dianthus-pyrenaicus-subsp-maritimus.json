    "intro": "Dianthus pyrenaicus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the Maritime Campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of pink or red, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
