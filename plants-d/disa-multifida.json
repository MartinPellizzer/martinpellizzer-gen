    "intro": "Disa multifida, commonly known as the forked disa, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of vibrant, pink or purple flowers with a unique, spurred lip. Disa multifida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable environment."
