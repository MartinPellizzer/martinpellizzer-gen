    "intro": "Dodecatheon subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine globe flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Dodecatheon subalpinum is a member of the Primulaceae family and is known for its early spring blooming period."
