    "intro": "Draba vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba vvedenskyi is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
