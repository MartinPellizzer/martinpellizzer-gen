    "intro": "Dalbergia hygrophila var. nephrocarpa, commonly known as the kidney-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and heart-shaped leaves that are often kidney-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found in lowland rainforests. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
