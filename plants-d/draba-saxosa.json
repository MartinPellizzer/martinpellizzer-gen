    "intro": "Draba saxosa, commonly known as the saxifrage bellflower, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Draba saxosa is an annual or biennial species, often found in mountainous regions where it blooms in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth form and frost-resistant properties make it well-suited to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
