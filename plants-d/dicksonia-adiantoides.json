    "intro": "Dicksonia adiantoides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bioluminescent fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its fronds are composed of a central axis with many small, finger-like segments, and they are typically gray-green in color. Dicksonia adiantoides plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to the local biodiversity."
