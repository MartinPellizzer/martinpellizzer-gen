    "intro": "Davallia speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often curl and twist, resembling the shapes found in cave environments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded conditions, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This species is notable for its ability to adapt to low-light conditions and its ornamental appeal in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
