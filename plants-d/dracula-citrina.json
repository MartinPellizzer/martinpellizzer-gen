    "intro": "Dracula citrina, commonly known as the yellow dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling the scales of a dragon, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific species of bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Dracula citrina is considered critically endangered."
