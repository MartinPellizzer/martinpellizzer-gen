It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a wetland indicator species."
