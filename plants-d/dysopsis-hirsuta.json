It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Dysopsis hirsuta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
