    "intro": "Dryopteris simulans, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
