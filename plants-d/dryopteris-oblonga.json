    "intro": "Dryopteris oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are oblong and often have a distinct midrib. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides, and it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. It is a perennial plant that produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
