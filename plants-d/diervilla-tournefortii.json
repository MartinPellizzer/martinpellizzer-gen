    "intro": "Diervilla tournefortii, commonly known as the goldenberry bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in culinary applications. Diervilla tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
