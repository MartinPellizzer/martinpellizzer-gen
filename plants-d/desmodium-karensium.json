    "intro": "Desmodium karensium, commonly known as velvet bean or sickle bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it also plays a role in soil enrichment."
