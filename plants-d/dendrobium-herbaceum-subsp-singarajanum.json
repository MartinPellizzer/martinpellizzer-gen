It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
