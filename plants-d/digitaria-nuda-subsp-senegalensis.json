    "intro": "Digitaria nuda subsp. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields."
