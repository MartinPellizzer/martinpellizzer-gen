    "intro": "Dryopteris jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
