    "intro": "Delostoma latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf blister beetle plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onygenaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that resemble small, inflated blisters. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are broad and somewhat succulent, contributing to its common name. Delostoma latifolium plays a role in local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
