    "intro": "Diplosiphon oryzetorum, commonly known as the rice fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in marshy or wetland habitats, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplosiphon oryzetorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of wetland habitats."
