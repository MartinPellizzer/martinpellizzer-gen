    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnosora var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
