It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and the challenges it faces due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this species from extinction."
