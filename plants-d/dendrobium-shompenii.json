    "intro": "Dendrobium shompenii, commonly known as the Shompen orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
