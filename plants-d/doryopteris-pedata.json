    "intro": "Doryopteris pedata, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often divided into broad, overlapping segments. The fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, preferring cool and humid environments. Its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in woodland settings make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
