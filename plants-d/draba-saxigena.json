    "intro": "Draba saxigena, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba saxigena is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
