    "intro": "Delabechea rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Delabechea rupestris is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
