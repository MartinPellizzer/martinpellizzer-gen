    "intro": "Dracophyllum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf drako, is a shrub native to the cool, humid climates of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are evergreen and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Dracophyllum brachyphyllum is often found in coastal and forested areas, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
