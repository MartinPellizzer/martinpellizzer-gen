    "intro": "Drosera filipes, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, hairless stems and small, sticky glands that secrete a viscous liquid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swampy areas. Its leaves are linear and often have a reddish hue, which can change with light exposure. Drosera filipes is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions."
