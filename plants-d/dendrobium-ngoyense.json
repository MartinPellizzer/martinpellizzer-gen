It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium ngoyense is notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential horticultural value."
