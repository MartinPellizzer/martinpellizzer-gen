    "intro": "Deyeuxia montanensis, commonly known as the mountain false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Deyeuxia montanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
