    "intro": "Dryopteris rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features a dense, dark green frond with a leathery texture and a distinctive, compact shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
