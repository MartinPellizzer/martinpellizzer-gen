    "intro": "Desmophyla aliena, commonly known as the starlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in shaded forest understories. Its unique reproductive system involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Desmophyla aliena is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
