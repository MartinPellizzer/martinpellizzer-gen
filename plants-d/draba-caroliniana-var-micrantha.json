    "intro": "Draba caroliniana var. micrantha, commonly known as the Carolina rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, oblanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to flourish in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
