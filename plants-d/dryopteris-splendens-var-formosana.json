    "intro": "Dryopteris splendens var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan lady fern, is a variant of the elegant lady fern native to Taiwan. It is a medium-sized fern with delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in forest ecosystems."
