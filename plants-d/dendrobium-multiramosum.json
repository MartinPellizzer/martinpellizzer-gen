    "intro": "Dendrobium multiramosum, commonly known as the branched dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, often in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces long, branching pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings, appearing in clusters along the stems. Dendrobium multiramosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
