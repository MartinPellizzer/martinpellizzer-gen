    "intro": "Drosera americana, commonly known as the American sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish. Drosera americana reproduces through seeds and can also propagate vegetatively through its rhizomes."
