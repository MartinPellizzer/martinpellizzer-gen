    "intro": "Desmodium paucinervium, commonly known as small-veined desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or ascending, with hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules."
