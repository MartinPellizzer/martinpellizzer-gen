    "intro": "Dracaena papahu, commonly known as the red dracaena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. Dracaena papahu thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
