    "intro": "Diphysa robinioides, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to its ecological significance."
