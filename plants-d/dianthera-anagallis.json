It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
