    "intro": "Delphinium elatum lusus glabrum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Alps. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates."
