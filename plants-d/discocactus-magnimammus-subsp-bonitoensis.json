    "intro": "Discocactus magnimammus subsp. bonitoensis, commonly known as the Bonitoensis Discocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, rounded stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust growth and distinctive spination pattern, which sets it apart from other members of the Discocactus genus."
