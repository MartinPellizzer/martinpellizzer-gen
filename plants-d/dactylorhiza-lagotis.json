    "intro": "Dactylorhiza lagotis, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Dactylorhiza lagotis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in peat bogs and marshes."
