It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
