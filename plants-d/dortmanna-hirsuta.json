    "intro": "Dortmanna hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along stream banks. Dortmanna hirsuta is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
