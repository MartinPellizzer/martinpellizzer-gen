    "intro": "Dupatya polytrichoides, commonly known as the Philippine moss or Philippine clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, upright stature and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a simple, dichotomous branching pattern and produces sporophylls that bear spores on their upper surfaces. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dupatya polytrichoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
