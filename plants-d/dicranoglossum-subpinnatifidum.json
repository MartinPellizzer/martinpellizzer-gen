    "intro": "Dicranoglossum subpinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its fronds are usually erect and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a distinctive pinnate structure. Dicranoglossum subpinnatifidum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting local biodiversity."
