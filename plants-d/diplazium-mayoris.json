    "intro": "Diplazium mayoris, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that helps it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. Diplazium mayoris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
