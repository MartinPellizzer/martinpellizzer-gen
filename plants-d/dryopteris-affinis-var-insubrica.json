    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. insubrica, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, strap-like fronds that are often tinged with a reddish or cinnamon-colored hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
