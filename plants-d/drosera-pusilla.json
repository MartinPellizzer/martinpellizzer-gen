    "intro": "Drosera pusilla, commonly known as the common sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to various regions of Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or heathlands. Its small, delicate leaves form a rosette, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers during the growing season. Drosera pusilla is a hardy species that can survive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
