    "intro": "Dortmanna feayana, commonly known as the Feay's Dortmanna, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dortmanna feayana is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
