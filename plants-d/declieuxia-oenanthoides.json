    "intro": "Declieuxia oenanthoides, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
