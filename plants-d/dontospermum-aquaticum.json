    "intro": "Dontospermum aquaticum, commonly known as water spurge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without proper precautions."
