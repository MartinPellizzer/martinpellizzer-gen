    "intro": "Dryopteris sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's robust and ornamental appearance makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
