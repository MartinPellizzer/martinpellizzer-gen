    "intro": "Drymoanthus minutus, commonly known as the small drymoanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
