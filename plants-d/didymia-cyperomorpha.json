It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are its primary floral structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Didymia cyperomorpha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
