    "intro": "Draba linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in a basal rosette, and it is characterized by its low-growing, compact form. Draba linearifolia is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers."
