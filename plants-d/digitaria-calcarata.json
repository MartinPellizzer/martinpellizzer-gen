    "intro": "Digitaria calcarata, commonly known as the roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a slender stem. It is drought-tolerant and often used in erosion control due to its ability to establish quickly. The species is also valued in some regions for forage and as a component of native plant communities."
