    "intro": "Davallia oligophlebia, commonly known as the silver-veined hoya, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically light green with prominent silver veins. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Davallia oligophlebia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
