It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnately compound leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and dark green, providing a lush, tropical aesthetic. This variety thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor spaces due to its elegant foliage and adaptability."
