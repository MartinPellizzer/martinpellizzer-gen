It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salty or arid conditions. This species is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
