    "intro": "Dianthus petteri, commonly known as the Sierra dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Dianthus petteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
