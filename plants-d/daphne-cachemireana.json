    "intro": "Daphne cachemireana, commonly known as the Kashmir daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It features aromatic, glossy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and its ability to thrive in well-drained, slightly acidic soils. It is relatively cold-hardy and can tolerate light shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
