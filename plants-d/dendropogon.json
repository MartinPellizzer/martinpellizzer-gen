It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often branched stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Dendropogon species are often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
