    "intro": "Dalbergia velutina f. burmanica, commonly known as Burmese rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
