    "intro": "Dryopteris rigida, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its mature fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Dryopteris rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
