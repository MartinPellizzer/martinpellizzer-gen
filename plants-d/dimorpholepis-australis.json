    "intro": "Dimorpholepis australis, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Dimorpholepis australis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
