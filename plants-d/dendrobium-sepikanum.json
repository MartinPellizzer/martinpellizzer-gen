    "intro": "Dendrobium sepikanum, commonly known as the Sepik orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the lowland rainforests of Papua New Guinea, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
