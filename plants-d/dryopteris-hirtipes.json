    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, wiry appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among many ferns."
