    "intro": "Duvernoia appendiculata, commonly known as the Guangxi cycad, is a unique cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy sarcocarp, which is an unusual feature among cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
