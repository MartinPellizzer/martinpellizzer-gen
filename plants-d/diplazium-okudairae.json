    "intro": "Diplazium okudairae, commonly known as the Okudaira's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming dense, carpet-like colonies on shaded, moist rock surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium okudairae is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
