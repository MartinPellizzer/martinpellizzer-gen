    "intro": "Dracaena bueana, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, dark green leaves with distinctive red or reddish margins that add visual interest to its appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena bueana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
