    "intro": "Dictyogramme lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically lance-shaped, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dictyogramme lanceolata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
