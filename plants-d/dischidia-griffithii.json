It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, red berries that are a source of nectar for various pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Dischidia griffithii is also noted for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it a versatile and visually appealing plant in tropical gardens."
