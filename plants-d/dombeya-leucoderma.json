It is characterized by its smooth, pale green to white bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Dombeya leucoderma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
