    "intro": "Dryas ajanensis subsp. beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian dryas, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season, usually in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various small invertebrates and mammals."
