    "intro": "Dalea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with stipules, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Dalea weberbaueri plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
