It is a small perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and in mountainous terrain. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba nepalensis is adapted to cold climates and has a high tolerance for poor soil conditions."
