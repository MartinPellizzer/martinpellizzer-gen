    "intro": "Dicranopteris litoralis, commonly known as the coastal water fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high humidity and salt spray. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the coastal environment. Dicranopteris litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
