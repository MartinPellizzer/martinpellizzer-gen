    "intro": "Dryopteris hispidula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
