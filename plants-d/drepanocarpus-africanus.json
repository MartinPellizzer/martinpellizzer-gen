    "intro": "Drepanocarpus africanus, commonly known as the African knobthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, knobby bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used for firewood or as a source of medicinal compounds."
