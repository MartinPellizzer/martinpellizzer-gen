    "intro": "Dryopteris acrophorus, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded woodland areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris acrophorus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability."
