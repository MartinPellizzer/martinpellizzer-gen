    "intro": "Danthonia racemosa var. obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
