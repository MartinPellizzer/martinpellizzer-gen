    "intro": "Desmodium oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's burr, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
