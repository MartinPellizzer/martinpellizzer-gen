    "intro": "Dendrobium scabripes, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, wiry stems that often bear multiple leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium scabripes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
