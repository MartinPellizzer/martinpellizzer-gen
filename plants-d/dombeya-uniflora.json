    "intro": "Dombeya uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Dombeya uniflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
