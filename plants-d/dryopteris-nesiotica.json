    "intro": "Dryopteris nesiotica, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette or clustered arrangement. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The western wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
