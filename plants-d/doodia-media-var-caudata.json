    "intro": "Doodia media var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and naturalistic landscapes."
