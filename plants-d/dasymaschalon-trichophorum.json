It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.
