    "intro": "Dryopteris cheilanthoides, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, sunny habitats. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
