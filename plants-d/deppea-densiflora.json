    "intro": "Deppea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered deppea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Deppea densiflora is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
