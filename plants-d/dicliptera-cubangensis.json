It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences. Dicliptera cubangensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment."
