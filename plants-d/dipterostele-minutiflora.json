    "intro": "Dipterostele minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered dipterostele, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique vascular system with a dipterostele, which is a type of complex vascular structure found in certain primitive ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
