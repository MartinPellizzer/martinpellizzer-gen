    "intro": "Dorstenia erecta var. varroniifolia, commonly known as the varroniifolia false heather, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
