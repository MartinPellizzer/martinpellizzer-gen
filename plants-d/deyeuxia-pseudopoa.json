    "intro": "Deyeuxia pseudopoa, commonly known as the narrowleaf false poa, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Deyeuxia pseudopoa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
