    "intro": "Dalea elegans, commonly known as the elegant milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a slender, branching stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea elegans is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
