    "intro": "Dryopteris cruciata, commonly known as the Eastern wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's intricate morphology makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
