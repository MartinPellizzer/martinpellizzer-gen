    "intro": "Dipterygia pozoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument-making, it is also considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species."
