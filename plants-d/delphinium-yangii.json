It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
