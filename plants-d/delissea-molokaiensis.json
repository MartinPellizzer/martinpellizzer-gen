    "intro": "Delissea molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Delissea molokaiensis is a rare and endemic species, found only on the island of Molokai."
