    "intro": "Diplazium aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny brake, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with serrated, often spiny margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
