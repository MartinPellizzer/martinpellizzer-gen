These plants are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, white, and purple. Dianthus species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many are cultivated for their ornamental value. The flowers typically have five petals that are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, and the plant often features fuzzy, hairy leaves. Dianthus plants are generally easy to grow and thrive in well-drained soil and full sun."
