It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Diplachne guatemalensis thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
