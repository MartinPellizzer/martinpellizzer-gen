    "intro": "Dimetopia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf dimetopia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its size and habitat, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
