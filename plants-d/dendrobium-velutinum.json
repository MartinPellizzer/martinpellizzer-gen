    "intro": "Dendrobium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of drought. Dendrobium velutinum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
