    "intro": "Didymocarpus brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the short-stalked flame tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its showy, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
