    "intro": "Dryoathyrium articulatipilosum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila at the tips of its branches, which contain the spores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Dryoathyrium articulatipilosum is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
