    "intro": "Dalbergia greveana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. It also has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of the forest ecosystems where it is found."
