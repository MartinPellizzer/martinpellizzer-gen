    "intro": "Dendrobium casuarinae, commonly known as the red-tipped dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, wiry stem with numerous nodes and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
