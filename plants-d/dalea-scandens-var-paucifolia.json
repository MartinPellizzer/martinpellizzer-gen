It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone hills and desert scrublands. The plant features slender, twining stems with small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in arid environments."
