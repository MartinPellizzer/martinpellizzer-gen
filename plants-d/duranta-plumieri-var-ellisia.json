    "intro": "Duranta plumieri var. ellisia, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually silver-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
