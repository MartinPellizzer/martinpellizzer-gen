    "intro": "Dillenia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf dillenia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody, spiky capsule that contains several seeds. Dillenia quercifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests."
