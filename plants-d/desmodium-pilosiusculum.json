    "intro": "Desmodium pilosiusculum, commonly known as hairy smallhead ticktrefoil, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being hairy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmodium pilosiusculum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
