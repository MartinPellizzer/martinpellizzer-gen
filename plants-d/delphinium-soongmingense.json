    "intro": "Delphinium soongmingense, commonly known as the Sichuan larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
