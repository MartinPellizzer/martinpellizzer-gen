It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and hairy, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
