    "intro": "Deinandra greeneana var. greeneana, commonly known as the Greene's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
