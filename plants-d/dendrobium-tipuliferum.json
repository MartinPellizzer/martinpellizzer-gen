    "intro": "Dendrobium tipuliferum, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of thin, white bark. Dendrobium tipuliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
