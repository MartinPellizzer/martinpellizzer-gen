    "intro": "Dryopteris uniformis var. crispata, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated, wavy margin. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a hairy appearance on the underside. It produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
