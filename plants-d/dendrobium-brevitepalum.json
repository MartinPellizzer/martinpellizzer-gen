    "intro": "Dendrobium brevitepalum, commonly known as the short-lipped dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium brevitepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
