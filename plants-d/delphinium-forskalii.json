    "intro": "Delphinium forskalii, commonly known as the Kashmir blue larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that split open to disperse its seeds. Delphinium forskalii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
