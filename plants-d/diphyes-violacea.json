    "intro": "Diphyes violacea, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, a characteristic feature of the Campanulaceae family. Diphyes violacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
