    "intro": "Diarthron linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved diarthron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. Diarthron linearifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
