    "intro": "Daphnopsis strigillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf daphnopsis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. Daphnopsis strigillosa is typically found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
