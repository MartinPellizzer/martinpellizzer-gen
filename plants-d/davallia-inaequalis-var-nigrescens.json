It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that contrast with its lighter, more delicate veins. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
