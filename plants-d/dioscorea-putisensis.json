It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. The plant produces oval-shaped tubers that are often used as a food source in local communities. Its botanical features include compound leaves with palmate venation and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tubers are typically harvested after a growing season of several months, making it an important crop in certain agricultural systems."
