    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 convoluta nothosubsp. convoluta, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris carpathica. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive curled base that gives it its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens. This nothosubspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to form a lush, low-maintenance ground cover."
