    "intro": "Distichia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a slender trunk that often remains unbranched and is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow when ripe. Distichia macrocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or dry soils."
