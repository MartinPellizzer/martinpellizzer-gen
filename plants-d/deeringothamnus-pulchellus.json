    "intro": "Deeringothamnus pulchellus, commonly known as the beautiful spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, milky sap and showy, yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Deeringothamnus pulchellus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
