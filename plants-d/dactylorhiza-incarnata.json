    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, leafy stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and riverbanks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is often poor in nutrients. Dactylorhiza incarnata is a perennial species, often forming dense colonies in its native environment."
