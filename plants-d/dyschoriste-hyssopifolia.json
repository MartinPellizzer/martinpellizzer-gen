    "intro": "Dyschoriste hyssopifolia, commonly known as the purple tailed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, purple-tipped seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
