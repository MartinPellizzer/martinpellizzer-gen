    "intro": "Draba praealta var. yellowstonensis, commonly known as the Yellowstone Draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly found in the Yellowstone National Park area. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The Yellowstone Draba plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability in its habitat."
