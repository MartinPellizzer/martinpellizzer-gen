    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata subsp. rhoumensis, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It has a short rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers with recurved petals. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and locally distributed species."
