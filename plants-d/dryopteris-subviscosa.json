    "intro": "Dryopteris subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a unique, hairy indusium."
