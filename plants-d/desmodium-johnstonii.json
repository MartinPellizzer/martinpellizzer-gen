    "intro": "Desmodium johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's burr, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
