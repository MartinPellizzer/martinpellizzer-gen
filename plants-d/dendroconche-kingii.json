    "intro": "Dendroconche kingii, commonly known as the King's tree snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail endemic to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped shell that is typically brown or reddish in color. The shell is smooth and has a distinct, conical shape, providing protection for the soft body of the snail. This species is primarily nocturnal and feeds on a variety of leafy plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, Dendroconche kingii is considered critically endangered."
