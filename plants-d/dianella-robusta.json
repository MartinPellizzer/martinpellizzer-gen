    "intro": "Dianella robusta, commonly known as the broadleaf lily or New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, dark green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Dianella robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses by M\u0101ori for its fibrous leaves."
