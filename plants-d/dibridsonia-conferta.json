    "intro": "Dibridsonia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
