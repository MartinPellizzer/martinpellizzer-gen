    "intro": "Delphinium sordidum, commonly known as the gloomy larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Delphinium sordidum is noted for its ornamental value but is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids."
