    "intro": "Dryopteris chiriquiana, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
