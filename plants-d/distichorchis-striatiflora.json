    "intro": "Distichorchis striatiflora, commonly known as the striped flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, creeping rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that have a distinctive striped pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
