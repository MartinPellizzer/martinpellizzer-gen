    "intro": "Dichaea tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique morphological features. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, while its inflorescence bears a cluster of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dichaea tunguraguae is considered a vulnerable species."
