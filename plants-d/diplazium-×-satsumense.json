It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses."
