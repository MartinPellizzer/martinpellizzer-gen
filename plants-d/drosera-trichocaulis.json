    "intro": "Drosera trichocaulis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Drosera trichocaulis is known for its low-growing habit and is often found in sandy or peaty soils."
