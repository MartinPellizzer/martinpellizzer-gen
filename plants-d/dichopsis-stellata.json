    "intro": "Dichopsis stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped pincushion cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, globular shape with numerous small, spiny tubercles that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Dichopsis stellata is well-suited for rock gardens or containers, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil."
