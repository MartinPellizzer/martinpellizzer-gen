    "intro": "Diospyros thaiensis, commonly known as Thai persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange to red berries, which are edible when fully ripe. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
