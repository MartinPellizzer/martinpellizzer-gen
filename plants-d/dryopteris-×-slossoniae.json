    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 slossoniae, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris hirta. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, featuring a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
