    "intro": "Dryopteris lilloi, commonly known as Lillo's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Dryopteris genus, which includes many species of wood ferns characterized by their intricate fronds. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Lillo's wood fern prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
