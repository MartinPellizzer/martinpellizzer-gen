    "intro": "Dryopteris bissetiana var. hikonensis, commonly known as the Hikonensis wood fern, is a variant of the Bisset's wood fern native to Japan. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its lanceolate, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, particularly for shaded garden settings."
