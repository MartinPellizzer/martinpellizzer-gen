    "intro": "Disa clavicornis, commonly known as the horned disa, is a striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique, horn-like structures on the stem are a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name. Disa clavicornis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
