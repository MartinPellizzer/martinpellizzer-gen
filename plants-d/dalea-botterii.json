    "intro": "Dalea botterii, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple pea-like flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compound leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Dalea botterii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
