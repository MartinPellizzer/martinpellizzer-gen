    "intro": "Desmodium seatonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Desmodium seatonii is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
