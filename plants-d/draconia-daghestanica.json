    "intro": "Draconia daghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian dragon tree, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, lantern-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
