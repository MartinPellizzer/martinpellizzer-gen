    "intro": "Dryopteris tamiensis, commonly known as the Tami fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
