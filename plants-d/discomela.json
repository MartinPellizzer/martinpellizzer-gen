It comprises several species that are typically annual or perennial herbs, characterized by their small, clustered inflorescences. The plants often have slender stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped or ovate. Discomela species are native to various regions in Africa and are sometimes found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.
