    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum subvar. superbum, commonly known as the giant orchid or the golden orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in high humidity and bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. This subvariety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
