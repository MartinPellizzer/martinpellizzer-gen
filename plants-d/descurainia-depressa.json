    "intro": "Descurainia depressa, commonly known as the flatleaf tansy, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard species, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. It has a low, sprawling growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but also serves as a food source for certain insects."
