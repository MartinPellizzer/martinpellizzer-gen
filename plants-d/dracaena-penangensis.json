It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters at the base of the leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
