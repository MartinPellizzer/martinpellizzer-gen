    "intro": "Diphasiastrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health."
