    "intro": "Dossifluga bheriensis, commonly known as the Bherien mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its blooming period occurs during the spring, and it is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
