It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Dimorphotheca chrysanthemifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, daisy-like appearance."
