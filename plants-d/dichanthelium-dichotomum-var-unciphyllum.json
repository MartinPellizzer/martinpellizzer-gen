    "intro": "Dichanthelium dichotomum var. unciphyllum, commonly known as the slender dichanthelium, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed among the foliage. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring and summer months, and it is characterized by its unique branching pattern. This variant is distinguished from other members of the species by its shorter, more compact growth form and specific leaf morphology."
