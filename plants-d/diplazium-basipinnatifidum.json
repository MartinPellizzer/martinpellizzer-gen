    "intro": "Diplazium basipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, though this trait is more pronounced in certain related species. Diplazium basipinnatifidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
