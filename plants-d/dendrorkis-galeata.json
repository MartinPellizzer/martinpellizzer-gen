    "intro": "Dendrorkis galeata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, warm environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
