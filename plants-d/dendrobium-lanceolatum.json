    "intro": "Dendrobium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom sequentially along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in both home and greenhouse settings."
