    "intro": "Drimia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant blooms with striking, spatulate inflorescences that are typically green or purple in color. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils. Drimia polyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
