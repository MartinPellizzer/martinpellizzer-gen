    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coasts of Spain and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. The plant features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact form makes it ideal for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
