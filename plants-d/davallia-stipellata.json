    "intro": "Davallia stipellata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like soil or stone. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding an unusual visual feature to its appearance."
