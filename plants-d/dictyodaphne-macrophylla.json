    "intro": "Dictyodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fleshy, disc-shaped leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the Dipterocarpaceae family, through its haustellum, which extracts water and nutrients. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions and tropical ecosystems."
