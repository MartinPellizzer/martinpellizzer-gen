    "intro": "Drypis, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Drypis is adapted to harsh environments with deep root systems that access groundwater. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for landscaping in drought-prone areas."
