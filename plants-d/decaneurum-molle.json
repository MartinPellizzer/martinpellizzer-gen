    "intro": "Decaneurum molle, commonly known as the softleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
