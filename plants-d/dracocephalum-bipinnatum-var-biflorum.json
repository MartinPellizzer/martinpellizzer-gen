It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in whorls along the upper stem, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for gardeners seeking native, hardy species."
