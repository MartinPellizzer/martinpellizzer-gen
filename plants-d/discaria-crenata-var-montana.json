    "intro": "Discaria crenata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain discaria, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments."
