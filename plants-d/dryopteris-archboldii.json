    "intro": "Dryopteris archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
