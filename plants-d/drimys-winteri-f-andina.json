    "intro": "Drimys winteri f. andina, commonly known as the Andean winter's bark, is a South American evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional use."
