    "intro": "Digitaria bovonei, commonly known as the African fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Digitaria bovonei is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock in its native range."
