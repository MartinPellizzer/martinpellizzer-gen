    "intro": "Diphyllarium mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and ponds, and is often found in the Mekong River basin. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
