    "intro": "Dracaena purpurea, commonly known as the purple dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a striking purple or reddish tinge along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. It is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Dracaena purpurea is often used as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
