    "intro": "Davallia firmula, commonly known as the silver-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that are divided into narrow, leathery segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori. Davallia firmula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
