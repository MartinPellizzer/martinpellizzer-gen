    "intro": "Desmodium serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Desmodium serotinum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
