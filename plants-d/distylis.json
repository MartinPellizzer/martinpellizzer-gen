    "intro": "Distylis, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense, tubular flowers. Distylis species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They often have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
