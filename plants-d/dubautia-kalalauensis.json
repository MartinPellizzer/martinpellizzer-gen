    "intro": "Dubautia kalalauensis, commonly known as Kalalau dudleya, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Dubautia kalalauensis is adapted to the dry, rocky habitats of coastal cliffs and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique plant and its fragile ecosystem."
