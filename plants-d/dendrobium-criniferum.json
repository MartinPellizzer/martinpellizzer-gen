    "intro": "Dendrobium criniferum, commonly known as the feather-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often pendulous stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Dendrobium criniferum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
