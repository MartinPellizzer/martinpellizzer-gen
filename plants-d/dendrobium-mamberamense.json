    "intro": "Dendrobium mamberamense, commonly known as the Mamberamense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium mamberamense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
