    "intro": "Deschampsia confinis, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in alpine and arctic environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude conditions. Deschampsia confinis is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
