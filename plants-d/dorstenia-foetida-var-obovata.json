    "intro": "Dorstenia foetida var. obovata, commonly known as the stinking fig-leaf plant, is a member of the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in tropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces a unique, strong-smelling fruit. This variant is distinguished by its obovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Dorstenia."
