    "intro": "Darea furcans, commonly known as the forked dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive, puffed seed head that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
