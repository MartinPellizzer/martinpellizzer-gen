    "intro": "Dryandra nivea subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp dryandra, is a rare and specialized member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. This subspecies thrives in wetland or swampy habitats, often growing in association with other moisture-dependent flora. Its ecological significance lies in its role within these unique ecosystems, supporting specific pollinators and soil fauna. Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
