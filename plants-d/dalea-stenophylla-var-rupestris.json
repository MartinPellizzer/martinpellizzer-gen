It is characterized by its compact growth habit, small evergreen leaves, and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs and rocky slopes. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils with low moisture. It is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
