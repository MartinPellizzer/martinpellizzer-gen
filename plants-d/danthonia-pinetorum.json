    "intro": "Danthonia pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as woodlands and pine forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Danthonia pinetorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
