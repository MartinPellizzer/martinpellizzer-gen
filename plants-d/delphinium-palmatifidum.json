    "intro": "Delphinium palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leaved larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves, which are lobed and resemble the shape of a hand, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
