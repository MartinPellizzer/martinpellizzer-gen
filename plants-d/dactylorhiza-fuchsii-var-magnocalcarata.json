    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. magnocalcarata, commonly known as the large-spurred lady's-tongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive spurred petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a three-lobed lip that is highly specialized for pollination. This variety is notable for its robust growth and is often found in open, sunny areas."
