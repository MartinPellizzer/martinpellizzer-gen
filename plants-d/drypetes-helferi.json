It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain sticky, fleshy arils. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. Drypetes helferi is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
