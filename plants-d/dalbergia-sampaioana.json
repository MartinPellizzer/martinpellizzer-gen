    "intro": "Dalbergia sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaio's rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, Dalbergia sampaioana is considered an endangered species."
