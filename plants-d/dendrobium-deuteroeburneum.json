    "intro": "Dendrobium deuteroeburneum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in summer. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Dendrobium deuteroeburneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
