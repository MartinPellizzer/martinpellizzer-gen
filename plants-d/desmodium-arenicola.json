    "intro": "Desmodium arenicola, commonly known as sand clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
