    "intro": "Drypetes palawanensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-fruited drypetes, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
