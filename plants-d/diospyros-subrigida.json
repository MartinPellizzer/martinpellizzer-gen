    "intro": "Diospyros subrigida, commonly known as the rough-shelled ebony, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, raised dots. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its wood in traditional crafts and furniture."
