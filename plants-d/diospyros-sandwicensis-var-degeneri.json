    "intro": "Diospyros sandwicensis var. degeneri, commonly known as the Hawaiian persimmon, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red fruits resembling small persimmons. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal mesic forests. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is considered endangered and is a significant part of Hawaii's native flora."
