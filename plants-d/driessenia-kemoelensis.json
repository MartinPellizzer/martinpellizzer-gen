    "intro": "Driessenia kemoelensis, commonly known as the Kemoel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
