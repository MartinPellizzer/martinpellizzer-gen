    "intro": "Dalbergia oojeinensis, commonly known as the Malawi rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark timber that is highly valued for its density and rich coloration. It typically grows in savanna woodlands and prefers well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
