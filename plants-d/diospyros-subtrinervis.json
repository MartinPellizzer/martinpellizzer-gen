    "intro": "Diospyros subtrinervis, commonly known as the three-veined persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with three prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling persimmons. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often marked with lenticels, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Diospyros subtrinervis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
