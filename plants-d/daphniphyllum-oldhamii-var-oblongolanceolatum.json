    "intro": "Daphniphyllum oldhamii var. oblongolanceolatum, commonly known as the broadleaf winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure."
