    "intro": "Desmanthodium fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-green foliage covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. Desmanthodium fruticosum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
