    "intro": "Digitalis obscura var. rhiphaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while the flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the genus Digitalis. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rocky soils. This plant is notable for its medicinal properties, containing cardiac glycosides similar to those found in other foxglove species."
