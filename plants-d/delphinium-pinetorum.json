    "intro": "Delphinium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, sparsely branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly serrated edge. Delphinium pinetorum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a notable species in alpine and woodland habitats."
