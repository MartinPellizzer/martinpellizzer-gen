It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
