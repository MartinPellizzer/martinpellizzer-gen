    "intro": "Drosera pauciflora var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, sticky glands that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in moist, acidic environments. Its flowers are white, often with a slight pinkish hue, and are arranged in a dense, umbel-like cluster. This variety is notable for its unique appearance and specialized adaptation for insect capture."
