It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen, making it a striking ornamental plant."
