It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments on rocky slopes and cliffs. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
