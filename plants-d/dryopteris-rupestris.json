    "intro": "Dryopteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows on rocky slopes and in woodland areas, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features fronds that are leathery and deeply divided, often with a dark green coloration. It produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered around the veins. Dryopteris rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
