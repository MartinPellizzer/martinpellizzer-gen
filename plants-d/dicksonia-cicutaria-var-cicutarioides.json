    "intro": "Dicksonia cicutaria var. cicutarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
