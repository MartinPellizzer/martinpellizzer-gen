    "intro": "Delonix regia var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a variant of the flame tree species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage and rugged, fissured bark. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody pods that contain flat, seed-bearing structures. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its vibrant floral display."
