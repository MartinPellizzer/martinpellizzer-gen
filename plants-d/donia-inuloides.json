    "intro": "Donia inuloides, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the daisy family. Donia inuloides is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
