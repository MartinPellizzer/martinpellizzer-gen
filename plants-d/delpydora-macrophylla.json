    "intro": "Delpydora macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Delpydora macrophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by offering shelter to aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
