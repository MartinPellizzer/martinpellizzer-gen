    "intro": "Diplazium lobulosum var. shilinicola, commonly known as the Shilin rock fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
