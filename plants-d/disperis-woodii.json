    "intro": "Disperis woodii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and critically endangered species native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a slender stem and a single, showy flower. The plant has a short flowering period, typically occurring during the rainy season, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique morphology and ecological significance highlight the importance of protecting this rare botanical species."
