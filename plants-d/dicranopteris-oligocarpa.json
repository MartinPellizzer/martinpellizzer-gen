    "intro": "Dicranopteris oligocarpa, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
