    "intro": "Derris acuminata, commonly known as the African snakewood or African krait tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid curare, which has been historically used in poison-tipped darts by indigenous peoples. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and culturally important in certain regions."
