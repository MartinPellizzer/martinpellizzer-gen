    "intro": "Dasiphora pimpinelloides, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and tundra habitats at high elevations. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
