It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive wavy margin. Delphinium diversifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
