    "intro": "Dacryodes costanensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic, resinous bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
