    "intro": "Desmodium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by hairy, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium triflorum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
