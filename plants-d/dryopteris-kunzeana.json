    "intro": "Dryopteris kunzeana, commonly known as the Kunze's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
