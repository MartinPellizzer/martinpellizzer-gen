    "intro": "Draba reptans var. stellifera, commonly known as the star-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, wind-swept environments."
