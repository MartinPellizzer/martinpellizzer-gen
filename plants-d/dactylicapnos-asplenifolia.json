    "intro": "Dactylicapnos asplenifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically grayish-green, adapted to store water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Dactylicapnos asplenifolia is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
