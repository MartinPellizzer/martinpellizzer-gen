It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a branching structure that allows for a compact form. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
