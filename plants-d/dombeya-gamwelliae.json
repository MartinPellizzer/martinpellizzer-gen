    "intro": "Dombeya gamwelliae, commonly known as the Gamwell dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
