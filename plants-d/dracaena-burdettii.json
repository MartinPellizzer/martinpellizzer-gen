    "intro": "Dracaena burdettii, commonly known as the Burdett's dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, arching leaves that can grow up to three meters in length, giving it a dramatic, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in landscaped gardens."
