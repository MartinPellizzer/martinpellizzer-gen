It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
