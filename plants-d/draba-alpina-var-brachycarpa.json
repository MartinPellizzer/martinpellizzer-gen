    "intro": "Draba alpina var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its flowers have four petals and are adapted to pollination by insects in cold, high-altitude environments. Draba alpina var. brachycarpa is notable for its compact growth form and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
