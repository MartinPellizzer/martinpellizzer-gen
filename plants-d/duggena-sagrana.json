    "intro": "Duggena sagrana, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a flowering species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Duggena sagrana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
