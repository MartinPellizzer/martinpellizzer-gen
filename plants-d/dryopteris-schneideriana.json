    "intro": "Dryopteris schneideriana, commonly known as the Schneider's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a feathery, bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
