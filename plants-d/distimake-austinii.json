    "intro": "Distimake austinii, commonly known as the Austin's ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Texas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring, often in shaded, rocky habitats. Distimake austinii is known for its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
