    "intro": "Dipholis durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
