    "intro": "Delissea lobata var. hamakuae, commonly known as the Kauai lobata, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a shrub-like plant with lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and typically appear in clusters, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and grows at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
