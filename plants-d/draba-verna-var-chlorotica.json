    "intro": "Draba verna var. chlorotica, commonly known as the spring whitlow grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. It blooms in early spring, contributing to the early floral display of the season. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a common indicator species in certain habitats."
