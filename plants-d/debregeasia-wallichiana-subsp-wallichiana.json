    "intro": "Debregeasia wallichiana subsp. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers, which bloom in spring and are borne on slender, erect stems. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
