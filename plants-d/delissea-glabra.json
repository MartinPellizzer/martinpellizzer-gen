It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often arranged in whorls along the stem. Delissea glabra thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
