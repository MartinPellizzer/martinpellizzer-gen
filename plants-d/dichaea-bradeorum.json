    "intro": "Dichaea bradeorum, commonly known as the Brade's dichaea, is a rare orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapting to the moist conditions of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dichaea bradeorum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
