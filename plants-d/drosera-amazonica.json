    "intro": "Drosera amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Despite its delicate appearance, Drosera amazonica is a resilient species adapted to the humid and competitive conditions of the Amazonian ecosystem."
