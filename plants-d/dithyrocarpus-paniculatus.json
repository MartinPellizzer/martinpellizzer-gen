    "intro": "Dithyrocarpus paniculatus, commonly known as the panicle tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a reddish sap. It is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
