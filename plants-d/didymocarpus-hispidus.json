    "intro": "Didymocarpus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of traditional medicine. However, it is not commonly used for commercial fruit production due to the small size and bitterness of its seeds."
