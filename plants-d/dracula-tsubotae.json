    "intro": "Dracula tsubotae, commonly known as the \"Tsubota's Dracula,\" is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and intricate floral structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers are short-lived but highly ornamental, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dracula tsubotae is considered a conservation concern."
