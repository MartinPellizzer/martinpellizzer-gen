    "intro": "Deparia jiulungensis var. albosquamata, commonly known as the white-scaled water fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant's most distinctive feature is the presence of white, squamose (scale-like) structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
