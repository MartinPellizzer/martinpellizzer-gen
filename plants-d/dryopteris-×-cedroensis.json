    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 cedroensis, commonly known as the Cedroensis wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. This plant is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light."
