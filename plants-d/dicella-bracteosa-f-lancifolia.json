It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, adding to its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
