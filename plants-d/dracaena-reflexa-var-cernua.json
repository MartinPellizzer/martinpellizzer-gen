    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. cernua, commonly known as the \"snake plant\" or \"mother-in-law's tongue,\" is a tropical evergreen plant characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that often curve downward. It originates from the Caribbean and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on long, slender spikes, though it is more commonly cultivated for its foliage than its blooms. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Dracaena reflexa var. cernua is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
