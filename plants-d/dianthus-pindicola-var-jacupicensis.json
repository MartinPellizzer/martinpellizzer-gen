    "intro": "Dianthus pindicola var. jacupicensis, commonly known as the Pindus carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically produces clusters of small, rounded flowers with prominent white or pink central markings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
