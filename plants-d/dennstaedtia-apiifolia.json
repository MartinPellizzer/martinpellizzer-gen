    "intro": "Dennstaedtia apiifolia, commonly known as the fern of the genus Dennstaedtia, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
