    "intro": "Deyeuxia intermedia, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually less than 1 meter tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-sided spikelets. Deyeuxia intermedia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
