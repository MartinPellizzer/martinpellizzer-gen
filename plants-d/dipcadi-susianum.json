    "intro": "Dipcadi susianum, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces bulbous structures that store nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
