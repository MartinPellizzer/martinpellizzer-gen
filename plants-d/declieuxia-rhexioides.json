    "intro": "Declieuxia rhexioides, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking evergreen plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Declieuxia rhexioides is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
