    "intro": "Dichondra evolvulacea f. subcoriacea, commonly known as the velvet dichondra, is a variant of the species characterized by its densely hairy, almost velvety foliage. This plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The leaves are usually a deep green color, and the plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are not particularly showy. It is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit and ornamental foliage."
