    "intro": "Delphinium glareosum var. caprorum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Delphinium glareosum var. caprorum is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in rocky or meadow environments at high altitudes."
