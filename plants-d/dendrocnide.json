    "intro": "Dendrocnide, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. Dendrocnide species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They have heart-shaped leaves and produce small, greenish flowers. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are known for their potent defensive mechanisms."
