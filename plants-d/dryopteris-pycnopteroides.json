    "intro": "Dryopteris pycnopteroides, commonly known as the dense-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that give it a distinctive, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
