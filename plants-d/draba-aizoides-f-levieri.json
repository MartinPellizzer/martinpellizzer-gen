    "intro": "Draba aizoides f. levieri, commonly known as the Levieri's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of linear leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to mountainous regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and cold, high-altitude conditions."
