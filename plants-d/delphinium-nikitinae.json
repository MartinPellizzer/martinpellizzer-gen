    "intro": "Delphinium nikitinae, commonly known as Nikitina's larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This perennial herb is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with five showy petals and numerous stamens, arranged in a spire-like cluster. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
