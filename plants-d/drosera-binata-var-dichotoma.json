    "intro": "Drosera binata var. dichotoma, commonly known as the two-stemmed sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that often branch into two distinct stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that trap and digest insects. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its carnivorous habits."
