    "intro": "Deschampsia alpicola, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. This plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale flowers that bloom in late summer. Deschampsia alpicola plays an important ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
