    "intro": "Dodonaea foliolosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf Dodonaea, is a shrub native to Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
