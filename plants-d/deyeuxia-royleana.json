    "intro": "Deyeuxia royleana, commonly known as the Himalayan flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Deyeuxia royleana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
