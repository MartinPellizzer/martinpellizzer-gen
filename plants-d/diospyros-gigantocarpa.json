    "intro": "Diospyros gigantocarpa, commonly known as the giant persimmon, is a large, deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, slender leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by large, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible when fully ripe. Its fruit is notable for its high sugar content and unique flavor, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and tool-making."
