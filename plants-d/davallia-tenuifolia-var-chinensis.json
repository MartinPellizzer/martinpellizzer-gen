It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
