It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in dunes or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
