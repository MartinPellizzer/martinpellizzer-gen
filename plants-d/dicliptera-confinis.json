    "intro": "Dicliptera confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Dicliptera confinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
