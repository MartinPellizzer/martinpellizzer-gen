    "intro": "Dracaena australis, commonly known as the Australian dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Australia and New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Dracaena australis thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
