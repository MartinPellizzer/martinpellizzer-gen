    "intro": "Dryopteris mauiensis, commonly known as Maui fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a feather. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
