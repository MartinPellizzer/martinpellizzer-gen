    "intro": "Daviesia grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange flower spikes. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Daviesia grahamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
