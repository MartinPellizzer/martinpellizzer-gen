    "intro": "Dryopteris grandiosa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance that gives the species its common name."
