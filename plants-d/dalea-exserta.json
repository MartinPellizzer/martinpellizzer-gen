    "intro": "Dalea exserta, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it has small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. Dalea exserta is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
