    "intro": "Dendrorkis extinctoria, commonly known as the flameleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-colored foliage and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
