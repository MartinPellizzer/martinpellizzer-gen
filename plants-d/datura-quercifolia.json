    "intro": "Datura quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has ovate, serrated leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. Datura quercifolia belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its potent alkaloids, which make it toxic to humans and animals. It typically blooms in summer and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun."
