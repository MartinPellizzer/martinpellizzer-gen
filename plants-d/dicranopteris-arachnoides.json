    "intro": "Dicranopteris arachnoides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices, across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, with a unique ability to emit a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
