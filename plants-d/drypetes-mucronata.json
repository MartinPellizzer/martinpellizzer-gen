    "intro": "Drypetes mucronata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red fruits containing three seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
