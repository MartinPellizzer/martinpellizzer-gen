It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a compact, upright growth habit. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
