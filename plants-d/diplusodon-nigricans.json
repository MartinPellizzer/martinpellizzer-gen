    "intro": "Diplusodon nigricans, commonly known as the black-tailed skink, is a species of lizard native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the family Scincidae and is characterized by its slender body and distinct black tail. The plant in question is not a botanical species but a reptile, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features. I can't reply."
