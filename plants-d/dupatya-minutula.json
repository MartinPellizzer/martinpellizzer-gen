    "intro": "Dupatya minutula, commonly known as the small leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sorangs, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
