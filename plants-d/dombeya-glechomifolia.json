    "intro": "Dombeya glechomifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dombeya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
