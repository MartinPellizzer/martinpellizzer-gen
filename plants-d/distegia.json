    "intro": "Distegia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and used in traditional medicine. Distegia species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in clusters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
