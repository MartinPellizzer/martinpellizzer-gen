    "intro": "Dorcoceras rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and purple floral bracts. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
