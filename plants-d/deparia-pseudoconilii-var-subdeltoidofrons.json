    "intro": "Deparia pseudoconilii var. subdeltoidofrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to wetland environments. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil in shallow waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health. This variant is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaf shape compared to other varieties of Deparia pseudoconilii."
