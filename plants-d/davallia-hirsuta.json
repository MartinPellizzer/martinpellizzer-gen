    "intro": "Davallia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. Davallia hirsuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant and intricate foliage."
