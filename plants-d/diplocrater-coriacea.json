It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
