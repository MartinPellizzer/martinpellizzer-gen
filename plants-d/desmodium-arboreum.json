    "intro": "Desmodium arboreum, commonly known as the tree desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, often branched growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Desmodium arboreum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
