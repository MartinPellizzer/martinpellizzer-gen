    "intro": "Diospyros glauca, commonly known as the blue glauca persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is typically astringent until mature. It is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
