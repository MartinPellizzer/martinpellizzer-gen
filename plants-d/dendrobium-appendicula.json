It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium appendicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
