It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
