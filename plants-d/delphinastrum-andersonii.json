    "intro": "Delphinastrum andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces small, round pods that contain seeds."
