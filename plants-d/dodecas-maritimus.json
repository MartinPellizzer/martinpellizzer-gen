    "intro": "Dodecas maritimus, commonly known as the sea dodeca, is a rare coastal plant that thrives in sandy or rocky shorelines. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, helping it anchor in unstable coastal soils. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Dodecas maritimus is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
