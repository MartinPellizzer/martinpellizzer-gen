    "intro": "Diplazium himalayense, commonly known as Himalayan water fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
