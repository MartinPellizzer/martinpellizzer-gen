    "intro": "Drimia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-tinged African lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Drimia glaucescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
