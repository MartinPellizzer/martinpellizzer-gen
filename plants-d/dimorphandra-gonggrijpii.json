    "intro": "Dimorphandra gonggrijpii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The tree has a distinctive trunk with a smooth, light grey bark and broad, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by flat, leathery pods containing small, dark seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
