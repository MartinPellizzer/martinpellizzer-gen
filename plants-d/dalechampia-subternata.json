It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Dalechampia subternata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
