    "intro": "Dendrobium langbianense, commonly known as the Langbian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation."
