    "intro": "Dianella intermedia f. rosea, commonly known as the pink flax lily, is a striking variant of the flax lily species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its elegant, grass-like foliage that ranges from green to pinkish hues, and its striking, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a clump-forming habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its visual interest."
