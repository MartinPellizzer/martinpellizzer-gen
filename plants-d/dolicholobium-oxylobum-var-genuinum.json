It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose racemes, typical of the Caprifoliaceae family. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
