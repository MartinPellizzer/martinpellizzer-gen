    "intro": "Delphinium oreganum, commonly known as the Oregon larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its striking flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
