    "intro": "Diplacus torreyi, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Diplacus torreyi is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suited for xeriscaping."
