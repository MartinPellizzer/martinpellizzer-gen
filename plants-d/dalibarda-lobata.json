    "intro": "Dalibarda lobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed bellworts, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with distinctive lobes. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers. Its flowers are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are a defining feature of the genus Dalibarda. Dalibarda lobata is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils."
