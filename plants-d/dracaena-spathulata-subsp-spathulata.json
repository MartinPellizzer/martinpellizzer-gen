It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are a distinctive feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying qualities further enhance its appeal."
