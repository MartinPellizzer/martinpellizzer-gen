    "intro": "Dendrobium cabadbarense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium cabadbarense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
