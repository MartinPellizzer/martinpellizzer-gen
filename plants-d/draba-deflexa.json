    "intro": "Draba deflexa, commonly known as the bentleaf whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and often curling downward, giving it its common name.
