    "intro": "Doryopteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients. Doryopteris papuana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
