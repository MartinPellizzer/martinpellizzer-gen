It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Desmodium hirsutum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
