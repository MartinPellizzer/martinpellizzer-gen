    "intro": "Derwentia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate derwentia, is a unique flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are perforated at the base, allowing the stems to pass through, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
