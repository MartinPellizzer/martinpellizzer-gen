    "intro": "Dudleya attenuata subsp. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent perennial native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and often covered in a layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
