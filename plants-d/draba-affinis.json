    "intro": "Draba affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, often with a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Draba affinis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for various pollinators."
