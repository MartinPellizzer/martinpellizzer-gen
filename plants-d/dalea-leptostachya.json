    "intro": "Dalea leptostachya, commonly known as slender-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, oval legumes that contain the seeds, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Dalea leptostachya plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
