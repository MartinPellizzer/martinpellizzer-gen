    "intro": "Dioscorea nummularia var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaf yam, is a variant of the yam genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically followed by oval, tuberous roots. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its edible tubers."
