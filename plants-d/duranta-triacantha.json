    "intro": "Duranta triacantha, commonly known as the thorned duranta, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and thorny branches. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
