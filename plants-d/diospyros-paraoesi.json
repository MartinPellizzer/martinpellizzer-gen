It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland forests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to persimmons. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. The tree is valued for its fruit, which is consumed locally and has cultural significance in the region."
