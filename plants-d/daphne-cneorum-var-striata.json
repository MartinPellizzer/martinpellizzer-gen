    "intro": "Daphne cneorum var. striata, commonly known as the striped spurge laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale green stripes running along the midribs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and potential to outcompete native vegetation."
