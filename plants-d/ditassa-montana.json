    "intro": "Ditassa montana, commonly known as the mountain dittany, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate blue or violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
