    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa f. tenera, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a variant of bluegrass that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silky-textured leaves, which are typically a bluish-green color. The plant forms dense, compact tufts or clumps, with a low-growing habit that makes it well-suited for ground cover. Its flowering stems are slender and often bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or silver flowers. This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
