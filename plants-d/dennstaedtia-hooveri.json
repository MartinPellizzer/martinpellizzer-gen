    "intro": "Dennstaedtia hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex arrangement of pinnae. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
