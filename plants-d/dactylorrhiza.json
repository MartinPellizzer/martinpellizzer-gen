These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. Dactylorrhiza species are characterized by their terrestrial growth habit and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The genus is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
