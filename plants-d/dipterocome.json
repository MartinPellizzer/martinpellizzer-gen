    "intro": "Dipterocome, commonly known as the dipterocarp, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae, primarily found in tropical regions of Southeast Asia. These trees are characterized by their large, often buttressed roots and can grow to impressive heights, sometimes exceeding 50 meters. They are notable for their hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Dipterocarps play a crucial role in tropical rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of these regions."
