    "intro": "Dalbergia lakhonensis var. appendiculata, commonly known as the Lakhonensis rosewood, is a rare and valuable tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and high demand in the furniture and musical instrument industries, it is considered an endangered species."
