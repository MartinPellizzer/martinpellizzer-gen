    "intro": "Dryopteris glabra, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris glabra is a hardy plant that can thrive in a variety of soil types as long as it remains consistently moist."
