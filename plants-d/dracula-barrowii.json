    "intro": "Dracula barrowii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble the skeletal remains of a human, giving it its ominous common name. The plant produces striking, pale pink or white flowers with intricate, lip-like structures that are adapted for specific pollination by certain species of flies. Dracula barrowii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
