It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces two types of spore-bearing structures\u2014microsporangia and megasporangia\u2014hence its scientific name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important component of certain forest ecosystems."
