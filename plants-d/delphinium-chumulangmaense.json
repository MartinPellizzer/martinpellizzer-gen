    "intro": "Delphinium chumulangmaense, commonly known as the Himalayan larkspur, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a coarse texture. Delphinium chumulangmaense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
