    "intro": "Dactylaena pohliana, commonly known as the Pohli's pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Pandanus genus and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a spike at the center of the leaf rosette. Its foliage is often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to its durability and flexibility. Dactylaena pohliana thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to saline conditions."
