    "intro": "Desmodium fallax var. mandshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian burr vetchy, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
