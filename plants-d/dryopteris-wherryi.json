    "intro": "Dryopteris wherryi, commonly known as Wherry's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
