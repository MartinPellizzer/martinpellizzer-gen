    "intro": "Delphinium forrestii, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are showy, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
