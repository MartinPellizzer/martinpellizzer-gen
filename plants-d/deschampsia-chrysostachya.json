    "intro": "Deschampsia chrysostachya, commonly known as golden tuft grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant produces dense, tufted clumps with slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often tinged with golden hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green coloration that adds visual interest to the landscape. Deschampsia chrysostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
