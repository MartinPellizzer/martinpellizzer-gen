    "intro": "Dryopteris lobangensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The species is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
