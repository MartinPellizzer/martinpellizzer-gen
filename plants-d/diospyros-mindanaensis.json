    "intro": "Diospyros mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling persimmons. Its fruit is highly valued for its sweet, non-astringent flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. The tree is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
