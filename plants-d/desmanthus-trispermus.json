It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain three seeds each, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Desmanthus trispermus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
