    "intro": "Dendrobium hypopogon, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. Its stems are wiry and often branched, and it prefers warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium hypopogon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
