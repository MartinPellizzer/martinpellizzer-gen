    "intro": "Dupontia psilosantha var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is noted for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
