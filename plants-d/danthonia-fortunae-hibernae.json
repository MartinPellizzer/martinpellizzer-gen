    "intro": "Danthonia fortunae-hibernae, commonly known as the Irish mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Ireland. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in upland heathlands and moorlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
