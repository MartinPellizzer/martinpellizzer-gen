    "intro": "Dracophilus rheolens, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
