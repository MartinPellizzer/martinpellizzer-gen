    "intro": "Diapedium hyalinum, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Diapedium hyalinum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
