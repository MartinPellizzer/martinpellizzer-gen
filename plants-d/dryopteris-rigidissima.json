    "intro": "Dryopteris rigidissima, commonly known as the hard shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are dark green and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
