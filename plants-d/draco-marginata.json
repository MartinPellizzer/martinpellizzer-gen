    "intro": "Draco marginata, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique species native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, umbrella-like canopy and distinctive, spiky leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its most notable feature is the red, sticky sap it exudes, which has been historically used for medicinal and dye purposes. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to arid environments with poor soil conditions."
