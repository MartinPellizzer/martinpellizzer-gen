    "intro": "Dombeya macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from spring to early summer."
