    "intro": "Desmodium polygaloides, commonly known as the velvet bean or hairy nightshade, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Desmodium polygaloides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
