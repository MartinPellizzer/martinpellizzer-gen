    "intro": "Diplopappus bellidifolius, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
