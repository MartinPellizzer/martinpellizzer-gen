    "intro": "Dendrochilum glossorhynchum, commonly known as the golden-lipped tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
