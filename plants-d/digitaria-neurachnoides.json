    "intro": "Digitaria neurachnoides, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
