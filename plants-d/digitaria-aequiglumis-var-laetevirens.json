    "intro": "Digitaria aequiglumis var. laetevirens, commonly known as the velvetleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, elongated leaves with a distinctive velvety texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
