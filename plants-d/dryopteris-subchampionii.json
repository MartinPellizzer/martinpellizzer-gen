    "intro": "Dryopteris subchampionii, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a silvery-white to grayish pubescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
