    "intro": "Dactylorchis latifolia subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
