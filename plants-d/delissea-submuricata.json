    "intro": "Delissea submuricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved delissea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It features compound leaves with serrated margins and a generally rough texture, which contributes to its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. Delissea submuricata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
