    "intro": "Digitaria umfolozi, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Digitaria umfolozi is valued for its role in livestock forage and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
