    "intro": "Drosera intermedia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features long, slender leaves covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces a single seed capsule. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate and elongated growth form compared to other Drosera species."
