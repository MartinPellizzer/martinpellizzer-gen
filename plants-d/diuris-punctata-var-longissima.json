    "intro": "Diuris punctata var. longissima, commonly known as the long-leaf diuris, is an Australian orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained conditions. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade."
