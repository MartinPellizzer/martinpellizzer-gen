    "intro": "Dorstenia orientalis, commonly known as the \"tongue of the sky,\" is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a twisted ribbon, with small, pale green flowers clustered along the stem. The plant has a creeping, scandent growth habit, often climbing or trailing along the ground or over other vegetation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive, wavy margin. Dorstenia orientalis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
