    "intro": "Desmos dasymaschalus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed desmos, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, which provide protection against drought and herbivory. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Desmos dasymaschalus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
