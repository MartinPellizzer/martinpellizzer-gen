    "intro": "Driessenia microthrix var. pteroclada, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Mexico. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
