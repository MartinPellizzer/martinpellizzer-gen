    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. flaccida, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, pale green to silver-gray florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green color, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness. The variety flaccida is distinguished by its more floccose (fluffy) appearance compared to the typical form of Dactylis glomerata."
