    "intro": "Draba oligosperma var. saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra draba, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats or small clusters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to cold, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
