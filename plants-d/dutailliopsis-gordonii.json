    "intro": "Dutailliopsis gordonii, commonly known as the Gordon's dura, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves and striking, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually a vivid shade of red or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
