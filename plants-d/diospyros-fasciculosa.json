It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. Its fruit is a small, round berry that changes from green to red as it matures. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
