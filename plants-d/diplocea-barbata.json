    "intro": "Diplocea barbata, commonly known as the barbed diplocea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, barbed stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
