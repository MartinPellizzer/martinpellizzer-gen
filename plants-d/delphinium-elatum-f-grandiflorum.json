    "intro": "Delphinium elatum f. grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The flowers are arranged in dense spikes and consist of five petals, with the upper petal often forming a distinctive hood-like structure. This plant thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking dramatic floral displays. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic to humans and animals."
