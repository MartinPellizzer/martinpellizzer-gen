    "intro": "Deguelia decorticans, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils."
