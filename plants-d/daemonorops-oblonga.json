    "intro": "Daemonorops oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Daemonorops oblonga is considered vulnerable to extinction."
