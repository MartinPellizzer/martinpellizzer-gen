    "intro": "Dryopteris woodsiisora, commonly known as the Wood's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
