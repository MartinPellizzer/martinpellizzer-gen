    "intro": "Dillenia rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove dillenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in tidal zones. Dillenia rhizophora plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
