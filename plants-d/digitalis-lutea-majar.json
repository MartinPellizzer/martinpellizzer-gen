    "intro": "Digitalis lutea-majar, commonly known as the yellow foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of tubular, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Digitalis lutea-majar is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic cardiac glycosides that require careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments."
