    "intro": "Decaisnina glauca, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Decaisnina glauca is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
