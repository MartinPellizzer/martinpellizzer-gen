It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring a deep root system and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is particularly resilient, thriving in sandy soils and extreme temperatures."
