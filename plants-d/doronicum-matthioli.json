    "intro": "Doronicum matthioli, commonly known as the Alpine goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, tubular disc florets that are often overlooked but are essential for its reproductive cycle. Doronicum matthioli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant spring blooms."
