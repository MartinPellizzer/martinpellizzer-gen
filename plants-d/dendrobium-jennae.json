    "intro": "Dendrobium jennae, commonly known as the Jennae orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky slopes. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
