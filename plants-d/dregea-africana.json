It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a rough texture, while its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds.
