    "intro": "Diplazium aridum, commonly known as the desert fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. Diplazium aridum thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats."
