It grows on trees, using them for support without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a popular subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts."
