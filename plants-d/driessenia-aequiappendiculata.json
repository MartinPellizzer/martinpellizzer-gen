It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and a short, woody stem that typically grows on the branches of host trees. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds. This species is native to South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
