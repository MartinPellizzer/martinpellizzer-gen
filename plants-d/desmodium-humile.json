    "intro": "Desmodium humile, commonly known as smallleaf burr medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. Desmodium humile is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
