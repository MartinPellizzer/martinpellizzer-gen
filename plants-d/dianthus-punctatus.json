    "intro": "Dianthus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted carnation, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink and white. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus punctatus is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a decorative plant."
