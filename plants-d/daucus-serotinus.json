    "intro": "Daucus serotinus, commonly known as late carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant produces yellow flowers in its second year, typically from late summer to early autumn. Its roots are generally smaller and less flavorful compared to the domesticated carrot. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
