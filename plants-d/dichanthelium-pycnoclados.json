    "intro": "Dichanthelium pycnoclados, commonly known as the dense-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in coastal areas. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
