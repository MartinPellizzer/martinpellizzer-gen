    "intro": "Digitaria littoralis, commonly known as coastal digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in wetland and estuarine environments."
