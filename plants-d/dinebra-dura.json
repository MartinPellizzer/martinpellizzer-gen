    "intro": "Dinebra dura, commonly known as the hardy dune grass, is a resilient plant adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, fibrous stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait in grasses. Dinebra dura is known for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion through its extensive root system. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in harsh, saline conditions where few other plants can survive."
