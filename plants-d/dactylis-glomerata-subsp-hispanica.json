    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish oat grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
