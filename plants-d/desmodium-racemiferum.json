    "intro": "Desmodium racemiferum, commonly known as the raceme burr legume, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that mature into fluffy, cotton-like structures, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
