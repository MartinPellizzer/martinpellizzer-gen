    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. cretica, commonly known as Cretan brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, tufted culms with dense clusters of spikelets along the stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that distinguishes it from other grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
