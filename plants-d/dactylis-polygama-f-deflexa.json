    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. deflexa, commonly known as the flexed brome, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and slender, wiry stems. The leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a blue-green sheen, and the inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many grass species. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop."
