    "intro": "Dalea tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Dalea tridactylites is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
