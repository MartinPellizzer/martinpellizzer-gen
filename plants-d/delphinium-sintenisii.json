    "intro": "Delphinium sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive silver-gray underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Delphinium sintenisii is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
