    "intro": "Dryopteris horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into feather-like segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
