    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. detonsa, commonly known as the bentgrass or silver bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, smooth, and have a silver-gray sheen, which gives it its common name. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
