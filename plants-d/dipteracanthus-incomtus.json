    "intro": "Dipteracanthus incomtus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble small, ghostly apparitions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
