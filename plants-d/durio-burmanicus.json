    "intro": "Durio burmanicus, commonly known as the Burmese durian, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, spiky fruit, which is similar to the common durian but generally smaller. The plant produces creamy-white flowers with five petals and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Its fruit is valued for its unique aroma and creamy texture, although it is less commercially cultivated than other durian species. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
