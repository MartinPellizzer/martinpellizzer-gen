    "intro": "Drynaria prieurii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or cliffs, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria prieurii is valued for its ornamental appearance and medicinal properties."
