    "intro": "Draba tomentosa subsp. ciliigera, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its inflorescence is a raceme, with each flower having four sepals and four petals. This subspecies is characterized by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the Draba genus."
