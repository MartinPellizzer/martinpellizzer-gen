    "intro": "Dorema odoriferum, commonly known as the fragrant dorema, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Dorema odoriferum is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
