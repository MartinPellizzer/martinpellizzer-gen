    "intro": "Didymoglossum crispulum, commonly known as the curly-leaved moss, is a small, creeping moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. Its structure is simple, with no true stems or leaves in the traditional sense, but rather a thallus composed of leaf-like structures. Didymoglossum crispulum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
