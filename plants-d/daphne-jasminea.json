    "intro": "Daphne jasminea, commonly known as the sweet box, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features aromatic, fragrant foliage that emits a sweet, jasmine-like scent, particularly when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and often have a waxy texture. Daphne jasminea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
