    "intro": "Dendrocolla brunnescens, commonly known as the brown wood lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its leathery, dark brown to reddish-brown thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algal component providing photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches, especially in moist, shaded areas. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for forest health."
