    "intro": "Draba gracilis, commonly known as slender whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and the plant is well adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Draba gracilis is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and scree slopes."
