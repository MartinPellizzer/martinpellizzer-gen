    "intro": "Drynaria rigidula f. cristata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a unique variant of the common cliff fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crest-like fronds that give it an ornamental appearance. This fern is native to South Africa and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is a hardy plant that prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in horticulture."
