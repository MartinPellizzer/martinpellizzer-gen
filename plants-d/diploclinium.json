    "intro": "Diploclinium, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Diploclinium species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks. They play a role in local ecosystems, providing food for certain insects and serving as a host plant for some butterfly species."
