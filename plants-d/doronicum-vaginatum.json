    "intro": "Doronicum vaginatum, commonly known as the alpine lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive purple or reddish underside, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and flowers. Doronicum vaginatum is also noted for its ability to tolerate cold climates and partial shade."
