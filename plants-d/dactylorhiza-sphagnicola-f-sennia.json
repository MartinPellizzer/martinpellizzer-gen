    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola f. sennia, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in peat bogs across northern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its growth is closely tied to the moisture-retentive properties of sphagnum moss, which forms the basis of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
