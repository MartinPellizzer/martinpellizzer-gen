    "intro": "Dendrobium crassinode, commonly known as the broad-node dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that bear numerous nodes and clusters of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in late winter to early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its long-lasting blooms and unique appearance."
