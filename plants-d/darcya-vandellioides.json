    "intro": "Darcya vandellioides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet or blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate orchid-like blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
