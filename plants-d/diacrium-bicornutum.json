It is characterized by its distinctive two-horned structure on its reproductive organs, which is a key feature in its classification. The plant has a complex morphology with specialized cells that aid in its survival in water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters."
