    "intro": "Dendrobium potamophilum, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments near streams or riverbanks."
