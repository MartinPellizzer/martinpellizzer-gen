    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. pseudodisjuncta, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a variant of the eastern wood fern. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive shield-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, acidic soils of forests. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
