    "intro": "Discoluma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its slender, wiry stems and lack of leaves make it difficult to identify, contributing to its mysterious reputation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Discoluma is listed as an endangered species."
