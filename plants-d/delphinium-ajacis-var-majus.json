    "intro": "Delphinium ajacis var. majus, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though its toxic alkaloids make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
