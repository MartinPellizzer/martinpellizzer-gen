    "intro": "Daphne villosa, commonly known as the hairy daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, gray-green foliage that is softly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its showy blooms are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Daphne villosa thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
