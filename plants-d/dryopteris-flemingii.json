    "intro": "Dryopteris flemingii, commonly known as Fleming's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
