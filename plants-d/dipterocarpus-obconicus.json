It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its large, obconical (upside-down cone-shaped) leaves. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It plays a significant role in the ecosystems of tropical rainforests, contributing to biodiversity and carbon storage. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
