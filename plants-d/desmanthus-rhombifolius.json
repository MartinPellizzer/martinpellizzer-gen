    "intro": "Desmanthus rhombifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf mesquite, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and woodland edges. Desmanthus rhombifolius is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
