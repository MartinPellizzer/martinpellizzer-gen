    "intro": "Daucus carota var. serotinus, commonly known as the wild carrot or bishop's crown, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a small, ridged, carrot-like structure that is typically less than 1 inch in length. This variant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in medicine and as a food source."
