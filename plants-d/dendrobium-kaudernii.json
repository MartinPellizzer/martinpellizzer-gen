    "intro": "Dendrobium kaudernii, commonly known as the orchid of the moon, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium kaudernii thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot."
