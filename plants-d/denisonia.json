    "intro": "Denisonia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Denisonia is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
