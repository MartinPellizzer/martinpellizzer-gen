    "intro": "Dendrochilum mantis, commonly known as the mantis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, elongated flowers that are often green or yellow with purple or red markings. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, adapted for photosynthesis in its natural habitat. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
