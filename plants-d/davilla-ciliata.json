It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and have a distinctive silvery or white underside. Its small, fragrant flowers are white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, blooming in the spring. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
