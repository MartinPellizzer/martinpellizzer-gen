    "intro": "Dendrophthoe recurva, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through bird droppings, allowing it to colonize new host trees. Dendrophthoe recurva is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems."
