    "intro": "Dianthera tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly dianthera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
