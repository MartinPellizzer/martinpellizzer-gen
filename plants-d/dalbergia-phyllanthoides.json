It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
