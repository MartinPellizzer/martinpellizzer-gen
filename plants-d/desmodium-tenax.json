    "intro": "Desmodium tenax, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elliptical, brown pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Desmodium tenax is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
