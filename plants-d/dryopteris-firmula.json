    "intro": "Dryopteris firmula, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of silvery hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Dryopteris firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
