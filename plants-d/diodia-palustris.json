    "intro": "Diodia palustris, commonly known as swamp dill or marsh dill, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided leaves that are often mistaken for dill, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. Diodia palustris thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
