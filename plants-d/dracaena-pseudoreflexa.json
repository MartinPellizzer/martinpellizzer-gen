    "intro": "Dracaena pseudoreflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that appear at the base of the leaves, followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Dracaena pseudoreflexa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
