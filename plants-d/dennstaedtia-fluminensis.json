    "intro": "Dennstaedtia fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it in the substrate, while its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, elongated shape. The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats."
