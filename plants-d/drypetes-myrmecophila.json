    "intro": "Drypetes myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique botanical features, including the presence of specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants. The plant also has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
