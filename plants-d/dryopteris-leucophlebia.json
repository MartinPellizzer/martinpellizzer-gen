    "intro": "Dryopteris leucophlebia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance and a leathery texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
