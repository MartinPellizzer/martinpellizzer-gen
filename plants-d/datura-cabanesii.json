    "intro": "Datura cabanesii, commonly known as the Mexican devil's trumpet, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Datura cabanesii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its ornamental value is often offset by its potent alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals."
