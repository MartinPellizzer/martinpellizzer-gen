    "intro": "Digitaria heterantha subsp. meyeniana, commonly known as the slender digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
