    "intro": "Dipsacus acaulis, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking, feathery plumes of white or pale pink flowers in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, with a rough texture and a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. Dipsacus acaulis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
