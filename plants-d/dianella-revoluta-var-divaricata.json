    "intro": "Dianella revoluta var. divaricata, commonly known as the silver leaf lily, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a striking silver-gray in color, providing a distinctive visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats in suitable conditions."
