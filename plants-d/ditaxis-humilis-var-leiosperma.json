    "intro": "Ditaxis humilis var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-fruited ditaxis, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by smooth, spherical fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
