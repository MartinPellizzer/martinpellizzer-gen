    "intro": "Danthonia fragilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its fine, delicate blades that are often slightly curled at the tips, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is adapted to saturated soil conditions, making it a common component of riparian and wetland ecosystems. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia fragilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
