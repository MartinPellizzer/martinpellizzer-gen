    "intro": "Drosera nidiformis, commonly known as the nest-shaped sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in a dense, umbel-like cluster. Drosera nidiformis is a perennial plant that thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
