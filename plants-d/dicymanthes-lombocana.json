It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant features strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a tall, slender stem during the flowering season. Dicymanthes lombocana is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in forested areas, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal.
