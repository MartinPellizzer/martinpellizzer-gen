    "intro": "Dendrobium zhenghuoense, commonly known as the Zhenghuo orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a pink or red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
