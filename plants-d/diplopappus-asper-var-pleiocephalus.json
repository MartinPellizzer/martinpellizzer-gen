    "intro": "Diplopappus asper var. pleiocephalus, commonly known as the rough-hairy dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves. It is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassy and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the stems are covered in fine, stiff hairs. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
