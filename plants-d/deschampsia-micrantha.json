    "intro": "Deschampsia micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as streambanks and wet meadows, and is often found in the Pacific Northwest. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in riparian areas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
