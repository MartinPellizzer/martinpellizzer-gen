    "intro": "Dioscorea niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Due to its potential medicinal properties, it is of interest in ethnobotanical research."
