It is a small, herbaceous plant with basal leaves and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, featuring a compact growth form and a deep root system to survive cold, nutrient-poor soils. Draba tenerrima is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to the alpine flora's biodiversity."
