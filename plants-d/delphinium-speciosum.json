    "intro": "Delphinium speciosum, commonly known as the showy larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the Delphinium genus. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is toxic to both humans and animals."
