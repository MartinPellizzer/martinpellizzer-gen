    "intro": "Diplochilos, commonly known as the golden bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that resemble small bells, often clustered in racemes. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They have compound leaves with stipules and produce legume pods that contain seeds. Diplochilos species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
