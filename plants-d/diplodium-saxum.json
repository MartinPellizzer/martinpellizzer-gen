    "intro": "Diplodium saxum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Diplodium saxum is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly soils. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
