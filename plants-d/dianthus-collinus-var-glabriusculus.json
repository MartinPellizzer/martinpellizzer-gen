    "intro": "Dianthus collinus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the glabrous campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features simple, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers with five petals, arranged in a showy, compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine gardens."
