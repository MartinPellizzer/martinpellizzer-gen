    "intro": "Dendranthema calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone daisy, is a flowering plant native to rocky and calcareous soils in Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy leaves and is adapted to thrive in alkaline environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along limestone outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
