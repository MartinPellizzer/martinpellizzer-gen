    "intro": "Dryopteris lungjingensis, commonly known as the Lungjing Shield Fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
