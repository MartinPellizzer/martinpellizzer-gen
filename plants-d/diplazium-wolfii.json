    "intro": "Diplazium wolfii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
