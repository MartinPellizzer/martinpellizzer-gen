It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
