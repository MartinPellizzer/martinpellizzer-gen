    "intro": "Dendrocnide morobensis, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notorious for its painful, histamine-induced skin irritation caused by its fine, venomous hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a challenging plant to handle and is sometimes referred to as the \"devil's ivy.\""
