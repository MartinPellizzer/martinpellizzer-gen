    "intro": "Dodecadenia robusta, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a robust, woody structure with thick, fibrous roots that help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and palmate, providing significant shade beneath the tree. Dodecadenia robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters in height."
