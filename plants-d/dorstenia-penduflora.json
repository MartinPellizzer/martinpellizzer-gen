    "intro": "Dorstenia penduflora, commonly known as the hanging false arum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, leaf-like bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its stems are often pendulous, giving it a distinctive appearance that resembles a hanging structure. Dorstenia penduflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
