    "intro": "Discaria \u00d7 serratifolia var. discolor, commonly known as the variable discaria, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish or silver on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
