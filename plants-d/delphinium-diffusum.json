    "intro": "Delphinium diffusum, commonly known as the meadow larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system consists of fibrous roots, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Delphinium diffusum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
