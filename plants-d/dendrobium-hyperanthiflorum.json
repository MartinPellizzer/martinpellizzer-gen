    "intro": "Dendrobium hyperanthiflorum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the warmer months, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
