    "intro": "Dracula, commonly known as the vampire plant, is a genus of orchids native to the tropical regions of South America. These plants are characterized by their striking, often dark red or purple flowers that resemble the blood of a vampire. Dracula orchids typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in humid, shaded environments. Their flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are prized by orchid enthusiasts for their unique appearance and rarity."
