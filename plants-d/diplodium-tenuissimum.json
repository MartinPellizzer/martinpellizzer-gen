    "intro": "Diplodium tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender diplodium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Diplodium tenuissimum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
