    "intro": "Dryandra speciosa, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in dense, globular clusters. Dryandra speciosa is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is also a symbol of Australian national identity."
