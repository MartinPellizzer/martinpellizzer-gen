    "intro": "Drakaea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, often strikingly shaped flowers that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Drakaea species are typically terrestrial, growing in sandy or rocky soils, and they are often found in heathlands and forests. The flowers are usually green or brown with intricate patterns, and they rely on specific pollinators, such as thynnid wasps, for reproduction. Many Drakaea species are rare or endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
