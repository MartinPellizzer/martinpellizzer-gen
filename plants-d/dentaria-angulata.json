    "intro": "Dentaria angulata, commonly known as the angular toothplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in a loose raceme. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal use, though it is not widely cultivated. Dentaria angulata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
