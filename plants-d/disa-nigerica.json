    "intro": "Disa nigerica, commonly known as the black disa, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of dark purple to black flowers, which are highly ornamental. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Disa nigerica is typically found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
