    "intro": "Dorstenia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dwarf plant, is a member of the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique, spiraling stems and specialized leaf structures. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are typically small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences. Dorstenia longipes is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and interesting morphology. It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
