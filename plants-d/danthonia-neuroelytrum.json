    "intro": "Danthonia neuroelytrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
