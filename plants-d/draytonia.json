    "intro": "Draytonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. Draytonia is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
