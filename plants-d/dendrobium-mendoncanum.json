    "intro": "Dendrobium mendoncanum, commonly known as the Mendoconum orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
