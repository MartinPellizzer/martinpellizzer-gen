    "intro": "Dendrobium montistellare f. albescens, commonly known as the White-flowered Dendrobium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically long-lasting, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
