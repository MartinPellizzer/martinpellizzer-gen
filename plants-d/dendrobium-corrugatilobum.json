    "intro": "Dendrobium corrugatilobum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, branched stem covered with a thick, leathery sheath that helps retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This orchid is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
