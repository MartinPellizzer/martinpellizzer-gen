    "intro": "Dicranopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases, with spores dispersed by wind or water. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality. Dicranopteris rigida is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
