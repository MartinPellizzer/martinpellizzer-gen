    "intro": "Duggena tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly duggena, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Duggena tomentosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and modest floral display."
