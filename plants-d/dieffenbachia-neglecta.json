The plant is a member of the Araceae family, which includes many ornamental plants known for their distinctive inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
