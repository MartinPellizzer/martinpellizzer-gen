    "intro": "Daphne oleoides subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic daphne, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
