    "intro": "Dryopteris distincta, commonly known as the distinct fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often curved. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris distincta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
