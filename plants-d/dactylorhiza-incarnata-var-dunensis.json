    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. dunensis, commonly known as the Scottish bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Scotland and northern England. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs and damp grasslands, thriving in shaded environments. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in late spring, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet, muddy soils. This variety is considered rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
