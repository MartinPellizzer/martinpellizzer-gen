    "intro": "Desmodium triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
