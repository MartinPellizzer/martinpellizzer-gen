It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
