    "intro": "Dioscorea valdiviensis, commonly known as the Valdivia yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a climbing vine with tubers that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yam species but are less commonly cultivated today. The botanical characteristics of D. valdiviensis make it an important species for both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
