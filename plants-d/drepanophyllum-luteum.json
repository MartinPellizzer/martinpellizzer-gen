    "intro": "Drepanophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow featherwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
