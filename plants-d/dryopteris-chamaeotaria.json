    "intro": "Dryopteris chamaeotaria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
