    "intro": "Dendromyza puberula, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
