    "intro": "Diplazium sarojiniae, commonly known as the Sarojini fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
