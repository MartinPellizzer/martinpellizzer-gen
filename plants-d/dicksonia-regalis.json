    "intro": "Dicksonia regalis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with fronds reaching lengths of over 3 meters. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically brown and curled. Dicksonia regalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and montane forests."
