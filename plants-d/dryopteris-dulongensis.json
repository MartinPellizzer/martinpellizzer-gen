    "intro": "Dryopteris dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
