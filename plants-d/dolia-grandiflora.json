    "intro": "Dolia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered dolia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Dolia grandiflora is often found in woodland edges and meadows, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
