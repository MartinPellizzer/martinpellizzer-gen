    "intro": "Diplazium oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. Diplazium oldhamii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
