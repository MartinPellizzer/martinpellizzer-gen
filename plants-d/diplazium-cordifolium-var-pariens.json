    "intro": "Diplazium cordifolium var. pariens, commonly known as the Paries' sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions typical of its natural habitat."
