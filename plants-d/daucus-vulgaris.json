    "intro": "Daucus vulgaris, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features a taproot that is often used as a vegetable, though it is less common than its cultivated counterpart, domesticated carrot. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Daucus vulgaris is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
