    "intro": "Drymaria tenuis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed or sandy soils."
