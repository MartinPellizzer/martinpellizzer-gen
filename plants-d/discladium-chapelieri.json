It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to withstand saline conditions and strong winds. Discladium chapelieri plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
