    "intro": "Dendrobium crassulum, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that often produce clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with dark markings, and they bloom in late winter or early spring. Dendrobium crassulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
