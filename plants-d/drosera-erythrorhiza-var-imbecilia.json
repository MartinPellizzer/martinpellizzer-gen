    "intro": "Drosera erythrorhiza var. imbecilia, commonly known as the red-rooted sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through insect prey."
