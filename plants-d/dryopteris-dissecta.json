    "intro": "Dryopteris dissecta, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
