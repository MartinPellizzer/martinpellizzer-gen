    "intro": "Draba verna var. patula, commonly known as the early whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage, with small, basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
