    "intro": "Delphinium pachycentrum subsp. hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's delphinium, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features striking blue to purple spires of tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
