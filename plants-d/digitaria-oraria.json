    "intro": "Digitaria oraria, commonly known as the sandgrass or coastal sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal environments. Digitaria oraria plays a vital role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion."
