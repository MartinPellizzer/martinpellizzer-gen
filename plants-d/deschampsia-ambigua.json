    "intro": "Deschampsia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-sided, and slightly drooping. Deschampsia ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
