    "intro": "Dicliptera albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed dicliptera, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Dicliptera albicaulis is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
