    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
