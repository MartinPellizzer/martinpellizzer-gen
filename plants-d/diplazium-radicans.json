    "intro": "Diplazium radicans, commonly known as the spreading fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across the ground. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. Diplazium radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its botanical structure includes a network of rhizomes, stolons, and specialized roots that aid in nutrient absorption and water retention."
