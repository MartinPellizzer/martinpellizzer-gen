    "intro": "Desmoncus parvulus, commonly known as the small desmoncus, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
