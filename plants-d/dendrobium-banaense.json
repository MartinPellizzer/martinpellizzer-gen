    "intro": "Dendrobium banaense, commonly known as the Banaen orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium banaense thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
