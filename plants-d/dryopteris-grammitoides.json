    "intro": "Dryopteris grammitoides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-hued bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in such habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
