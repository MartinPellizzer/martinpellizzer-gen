    "intro": "Dryandra praemorsa var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Dryandra, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences that display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues, making it a visually captivating plant. The species thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
