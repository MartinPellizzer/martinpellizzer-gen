    "intro": "Doryopteris pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pentagonal-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil. Doryopteris pentagona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
