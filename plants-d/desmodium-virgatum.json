    "intro": "Desmodium virgatum, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
