    "intro": "Diplazium ambiguum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it forms dense mats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Diplazium ambiguum var. ambiguum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
