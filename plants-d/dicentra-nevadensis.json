    "intro": "Dicentra nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra bleeding heart, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It features delicate, heart-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
