    "intro": "Dichondra sericea var. tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing perennial ground cover plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of short, woolly hairs, giving the plant its \"tomentosa\" designation. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
