    "intro": "Didymopanax gardneri var. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which develop into woolly, spherical fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in warm regions."
