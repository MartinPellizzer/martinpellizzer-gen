    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate wood fern, is a variant of the male fern characterized by its unique, crisped fronds. It is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. The fronds are divided into multiple segments, with the distinctive crinkled or curled appearance of the pinnae. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and can thrive in partial to full shade. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
