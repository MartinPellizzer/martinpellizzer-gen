It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium barlykense is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the floral diversity of its habitat."
