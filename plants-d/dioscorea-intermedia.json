    "intro": "Dioscorea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. The tuberous roots are valued for their medicinal properties and are also used as a food source in some cultures."
