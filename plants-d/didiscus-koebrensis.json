    "intro": "Didiscus koebrensis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, flattened, disc-like shape, giving it its genus name. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture. Didiscus koebrensis thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
