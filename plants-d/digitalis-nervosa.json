    "intro": "Digitalis nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved foxglove, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Digitalis nervosa thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
