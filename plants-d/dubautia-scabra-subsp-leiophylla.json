    "intro": "Dubautia scabra subsp. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved Dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
