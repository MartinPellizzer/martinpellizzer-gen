    "intro": "Dalbergia miscolobium, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry to moist forests. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The tree is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological significance."
