    "intro": "Dryopteris changii, commonly known as the Chang's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris changii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its lush foliage."
