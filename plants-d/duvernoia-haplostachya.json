    "intro": "Duvernoia haplostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed duvernoia, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
