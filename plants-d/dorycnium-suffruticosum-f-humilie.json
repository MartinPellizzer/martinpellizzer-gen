    "intro": "Dorycnium suffruticosum f. humilie, commonly known as the creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
