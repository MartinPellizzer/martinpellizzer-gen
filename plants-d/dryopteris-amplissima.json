    "intro": "Dryopteris amplissima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the species its common name."
