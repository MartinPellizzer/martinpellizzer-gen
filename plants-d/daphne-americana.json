    "intro": "Daphne americana, commonly known as the American daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features smooth, grey-barked stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and pale beneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Daphne americana thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates."
