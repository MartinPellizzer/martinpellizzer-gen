    "intro": "Dioscorea stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its vigorous growth habit. The tubers of D. stenopetala are not only used medicinally but also have potential nutritional value."
