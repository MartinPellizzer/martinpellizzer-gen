It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin, waxy layer, which helps retain moisture. Diplazium pellucidum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
