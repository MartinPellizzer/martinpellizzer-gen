    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudosabaei, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year, contributing to its unique growth pattern."
