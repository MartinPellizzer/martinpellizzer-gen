    "intro": "Dennstaedtia novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
