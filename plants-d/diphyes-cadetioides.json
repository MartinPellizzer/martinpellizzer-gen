    "intro": "Diphyes cadetioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
