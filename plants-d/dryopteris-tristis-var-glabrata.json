    "intro": "Dryopteris tristis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth maidenhair fern, is a variant of the delicate maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
