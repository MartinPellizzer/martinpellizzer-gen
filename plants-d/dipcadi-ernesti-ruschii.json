    "intro": "Dipcadi ernesti-ruschii, commonly known as the Ernesti-Ruschii broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green, and it is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of stems and leaves, with a slender, fleshy structure that allows it to attach to its host. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is considered a rare and elusive species within its habitat."
