    "intro": "Dioscorea buchananii subsp. undatiloba, commonly known as the African yambean, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing herbaceous perennial that produces tubers similar to those of other yam species. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed margins and bears small, greenish-white flowers. Its tubers are used as food in some regions, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The subspecies is distinguished by its undulating leaf lobes and specific geographic distribution."
