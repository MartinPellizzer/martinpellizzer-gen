    "intro": "Dipteryx speciosa, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing the edible Brazil nuts. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, fibrous capsules, which require specific conditions to open. The Brazil nut tree plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various species."
