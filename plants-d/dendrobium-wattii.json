    "intro": "Dendrobium wattii, commonly known as the Watt's orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium wattii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
