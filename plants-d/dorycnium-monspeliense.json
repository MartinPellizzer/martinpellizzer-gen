    "intro": "Dorycnium monspeliense, commonly known as the alpine burclover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a bur-like capsule that contains several small seeds, aiding in its dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Dorycnium monspeliense is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates."
