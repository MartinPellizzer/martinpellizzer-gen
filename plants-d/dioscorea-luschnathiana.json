    "intro": "Dioscorea luschnathiana, commonly known as the Luschnathian yam, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for propagation. These tubers are not typically consumed by humans but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
