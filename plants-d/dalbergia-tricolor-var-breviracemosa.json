It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are dark green with a slight pubescence, and its striking flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, flat pods containing several seeds, and its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
