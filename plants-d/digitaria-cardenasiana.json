    "intro": "Digitaria cardenasiana, commonly known as the Cardenas grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Digitaria cardenasiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
