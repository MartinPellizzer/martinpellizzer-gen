    "intro": "Desmodium henryi, commonly known as Henry's burr legume, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant is known for its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. Desmodium henryi produces small, yellow to brown pods that contain several seeds, and it often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is also noted for its potential use in soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
