    "intro": "Draba depilis, commonly known as the naked-flowered winter cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Draba depilis is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or alpine soils. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive feature of having nearly hairless flower parts."
