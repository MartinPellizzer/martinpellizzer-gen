    "intro": "Dolichos polystachyos, commonly known as the many-stemmed cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers, which give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Dolichos polystachyos is valued for its nutritional seeds and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop in sustainable agriculture."
