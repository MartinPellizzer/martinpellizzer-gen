    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudomontana, commonly known as the False Mountain Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
