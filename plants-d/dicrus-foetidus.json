It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a distinctive, strong odor that is often described as unpleasant or foul. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
