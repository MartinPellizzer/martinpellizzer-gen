    "intro": "Diplazium celtidifolium var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The sterile fronds are typically longer and more slender, while the fertile fronds bear spore-producing structures on their undersides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
