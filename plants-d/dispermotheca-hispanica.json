    "intro": "Dispermotheca hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish disperser, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and capsule-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dispermotheca hispanica is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
