    "intro": "Dimorphosciadium, commonly known as the two-form scented leaf plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and distinctive floral structure. It typically features compound leaves with a pinnate arrangement, often emitting a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dimorphosciadium is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
