    "intro": "Dendrobium vesiculosum, commonly known as the bubble orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its leaves are linear and arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dendrobium vesiculosum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
