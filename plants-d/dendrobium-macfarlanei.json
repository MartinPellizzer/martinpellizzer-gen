    "intro": "Dendrobium macfarlanei, commonly known as the Macfarlane's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for climbing on trees or rocks. Dendrobium macfarlanei is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
