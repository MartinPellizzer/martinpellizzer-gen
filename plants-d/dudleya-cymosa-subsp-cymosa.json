    "intro": "Dudleya cymosa subsp. cymosa, commonly known as the Coast Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
