    "intro": "Donella ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrensis fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Donella ambrensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
