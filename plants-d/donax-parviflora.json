    "intro": "Donax parviflora, commonly known as the smallflower dune grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like structure and adaptability to sandy, saline environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Donax parviflora thrives in full sun and is often found in maritime dune ecosystems."
