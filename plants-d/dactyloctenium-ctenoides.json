    "intro": "Dactyloctenium ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and its distinctive, hairy, finger-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Dactyloctenium ctenoides is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
