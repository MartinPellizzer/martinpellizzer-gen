    "intro": "Dryopteris patentissima, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that are typically bronze to golden in color when young. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
