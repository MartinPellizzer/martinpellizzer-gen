    "intro": "Dracula vlad-tepes, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the misty cloud forests of Ecuador. This orchid is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its ominous name. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on the trunks of trees in shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
