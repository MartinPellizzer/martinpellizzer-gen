    "intro": "Digitaria leucocoma, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, silver-tomentose leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and prairies. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to a wide range of soil types. Digitaria leucocoma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
