    "intro": "Dryopteris tenompokensis, commonly known as the Tenompokensis wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that unfurl in a distinctive, spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health."
