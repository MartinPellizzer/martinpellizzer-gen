    "intro": "Drymaria cordata var. palustris, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in damp conditions. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
