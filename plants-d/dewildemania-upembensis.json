    "intro": "Dewildemania upembensis, commonly known as the Upembe wild orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its challenging mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are often fragrant and come in shades of white and pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
