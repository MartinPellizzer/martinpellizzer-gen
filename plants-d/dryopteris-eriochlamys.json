    "intro": "Dryopteris eriochlamys, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in shady garden settings."
