    "intro": "Donnellsmithia coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan donnellsmithia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Coahuila, Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, succulent leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid environments, adapting to extreme heat and limited water availability through its thick, fleshy foliage. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
