    "intro": "Diodia pilosa, commonly known as hairy doidia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss. Diodia pilosa is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
