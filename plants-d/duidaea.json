    "intro": "Duidaea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear to be in a state of decay, giving them their eerie common name. Duidaea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, while the flowers are clustered in umbels. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Duidaea plants are of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
