    "intro": "Diplostephium floribundum subsp. llanganatense, commonly known as the Llanganate sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and its potential use in traditional medicine."
