    "intro": "Dichapetalum donnell-smithii var. chiapasense, commonly known as the Chiapas dichapetalum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
