    "intro": "Dryopteris pachyrhachis var. straminea, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant features large, leathery, bipinnate leaves that are often used in landscaping for their visual appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its unique coloration and is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a striking yet low-maintenance plant."
