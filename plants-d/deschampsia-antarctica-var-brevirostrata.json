    "intro": "Deschampsia antarctica var. brevirostrata, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a hardy grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, including frost and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in polar and alpine environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
