    "intro": "Dichromena repens, commonly known as the creeping dichromena, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with two distinct color zones on the petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Dichromena repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or swampy areas."
