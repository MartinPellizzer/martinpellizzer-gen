    "intro": "Dryopteris arthrothrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
