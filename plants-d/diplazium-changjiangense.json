    "intro": "Diplazium changjiangense, commonly known as the Changjiang spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern life cycle. Diplazium changjiangense is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
