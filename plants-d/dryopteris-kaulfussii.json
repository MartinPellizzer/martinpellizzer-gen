    "intro": "Dryopteris kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a slightly curled or twisted appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
