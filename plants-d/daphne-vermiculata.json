    "intro": "Daphne vermiculata, commonly known as silver leaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
