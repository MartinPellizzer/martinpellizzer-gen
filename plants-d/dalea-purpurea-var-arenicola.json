    "intro": "Dalea purpurea var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dalea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, gray-green, and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
