    "intro": "Dendrobium praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often bear multiple leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
