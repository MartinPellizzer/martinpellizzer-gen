    "intro": "Draba incanohirta, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with basal leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a fine white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine environments. Draba incanohirta is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. Its adaptations to cold, high-altitude conditions make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
