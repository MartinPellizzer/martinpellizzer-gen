    "intro": "Dacrydium comosum, commonly known as the mountain pine or New Zealand mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Dacrydium comosum plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's mountainous regions, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest ecosystems."
