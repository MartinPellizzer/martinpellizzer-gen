    "intro": "Dicksonia obtusifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving and have cultural significance in New Zealand."
