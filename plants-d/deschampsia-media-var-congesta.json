    "intro": "Deschampsia media var. congesta, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The variety 'congesta' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser foliage compared to other varieties of Deschampsia media."
