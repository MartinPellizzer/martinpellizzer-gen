It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
