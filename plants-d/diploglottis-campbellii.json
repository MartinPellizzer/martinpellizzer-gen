    "intro": "Diploglottis campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's diploglottis, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
