    "intro": "Diploma pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean diploma plant, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous plant with distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
