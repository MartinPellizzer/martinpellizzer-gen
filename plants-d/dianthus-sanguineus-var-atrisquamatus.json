It features dark purple to black flowers with bright red or orange centers, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from spring to early summer."
