    "intro": "Dendropemon domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical forests of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its roots while deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
