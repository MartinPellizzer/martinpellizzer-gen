    "intro": "Daggodora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
