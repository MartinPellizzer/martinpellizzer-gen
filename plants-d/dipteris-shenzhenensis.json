    "intro": "Dipteris shenzhenensis, commonly known as the Shenzhen water fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Dipteris shenzhenensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
