    "intro": "Dovea ebracteata, commonly known as the leafless dovea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to related species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dovea ebracteata is considered a conservation concern."
