    "intro": "Dendrobenthamia ferruginea var. jiangxiensis, commonly known as the Jiangxi red-stemmed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Jiangxi Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with pale yellow petals and a deep red lip, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
