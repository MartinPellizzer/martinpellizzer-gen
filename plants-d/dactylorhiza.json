    "intro": "Dactylorhiza, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are typically found in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and stream banks. Dactylorhiza species are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, green, and purple. They have a complex root system and are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Many species within this genus are also prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
