    "intro": "Dulacia cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited dulacia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, small, blue-black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy appearance. The berries, while visually striking, are not typically consumed by humans due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity."
