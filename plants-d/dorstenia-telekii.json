    "intro": "Dorstenia telekii, commonly known as the African mountain star, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. This plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are typically elongated and spirally arranged, forming a rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Dorstenia telekii is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which contains latex and has been used in traditional medicine. The plant's resilience to harsh environmental conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
