    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa subsp. austrobohemica, commonly known as the Austrian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that produce feathery panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in wetland environments."
