    "intro": "Dupatya erigeron, commonly known as the blueweed or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most striking feature is the clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Dupatya erigeron is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
