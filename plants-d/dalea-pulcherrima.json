    "intro": "Dalea pulcherrima, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. Dalea pulcherrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
