    "intro": "Deyeuxia sulcata, commonly known as the ridgegrass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Deyeuxia sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
