    "intro": "Dolichos obcordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf dolichos, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive obcordate (inverted heart) base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Dolichos obcordatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of protein-rich seeds."
