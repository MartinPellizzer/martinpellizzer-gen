    "intro": "Deuterocohnia gableana, commonly known as the Gable's moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Deuterocohnia gableana is often found in alpine meadows and is a popular specimen for rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
