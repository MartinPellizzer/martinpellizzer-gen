    "intro": "Dodecatheon salinum, commonly known as saltleaf sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dodecatheon salinum is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
