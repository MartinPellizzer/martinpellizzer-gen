    "intro": "Dieterlea, commonly known as the dieterlea fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Dieterlea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. However, due to habitat loss, many species are now considered endangered."
