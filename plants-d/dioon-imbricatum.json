    "intro": "Dioon imbricatum, commonly known as the Mexican hat plant, is a cycad species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are bright green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
