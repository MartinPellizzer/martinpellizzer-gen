    "intro": "Dysoxylum cyrtobotryum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saline water environments. The plant has dark, almost black bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
