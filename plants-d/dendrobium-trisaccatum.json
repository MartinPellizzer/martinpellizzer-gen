    "intro": "Dendrobium trisaccatum, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Dendrobium trisaccatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
