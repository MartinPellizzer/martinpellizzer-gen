    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including poor and sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically rough and hairy, contributing to its common name. It is often used in pastureland and for erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
