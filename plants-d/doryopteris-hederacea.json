    "intro": "Doryopteris hederacea, commonly known as the ground-ferns or common ground-ferns, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Doryopteris hederacea plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
