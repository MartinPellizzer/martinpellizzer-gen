    "intro": "Digitaria clarkiae, commonly known as Clark's digitaria, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
