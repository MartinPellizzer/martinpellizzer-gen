    "intro": "Dissotis hockii, commonly known as the silverleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces triangular, three-angled berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Dissotis hockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
