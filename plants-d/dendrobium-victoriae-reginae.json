    "intro": "Dendrobium victoriae-reginae, commonly known as the Victorian Queen Dendrobium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
