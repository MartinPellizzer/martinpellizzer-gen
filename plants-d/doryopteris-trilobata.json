    "intro": "Doryopteris trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Doryopteris trilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
