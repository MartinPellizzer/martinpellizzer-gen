    "intro": "Dichanthelium umbonulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicles, with the upper portion bearing bracted flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
