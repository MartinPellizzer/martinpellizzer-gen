    "intro": "Dalbergia abbreviata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves, and its flowers are typically yellow or yellowish-green, arranged in racemose inflorescences. It produces small, flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, Dalbergia abbreviata is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional crafts."
