    "intro": "Dryopteris tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Dryopteris tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
