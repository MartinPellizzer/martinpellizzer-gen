    "intro": "Dianthus sylvestris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clustered pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
