    "intro": "Dactylis polygama var. trichophora, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and the presence of hairy structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. This variety is often used in forage systems due to its nutritional value and hardiness."
