    "intro": "Dalea, commonly known as false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their striking, often violet or blue, pea-like flowers. Dalea species typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are also important in ecological restoration projects."
