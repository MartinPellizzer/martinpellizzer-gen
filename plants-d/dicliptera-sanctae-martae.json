    "intro": "Dicliptera sanctae-martae, commonly known as the San Marta dicliptera, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
