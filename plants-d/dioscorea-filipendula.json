    "intro": "Dioscorea filipendula, commonly known as the Japanese yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern, while its stems are hairy and twining. The tubers are typically harvested in the fall and are valued for their nutritional content and traditional use in herbal medicine."
