    "intro": "Dryopteris amphioxypteris, commonly known as the broad-ovate water fern, is a prehistoric fern that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate-shaped fronds with a distinctive bifurcated structure. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, which allowed it to grow tall and support its massive fronds. Its spores were dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in ancient swampy environments. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the development of early terrestrial ecosystems."
