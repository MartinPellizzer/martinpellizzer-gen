    "intro": "Dendrobium bobolei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium bobolei is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
