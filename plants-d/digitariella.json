    "intro": "Digitariella, commonly known as the false button mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, often colorful caps and gilled structures, which are typically found in forested areas. The spores are usually produced in a distinctive, sac-like structure called a vesicle, which is a key feature for identification. While some species are edible, others may be toxic, so caution is advised when foraging. The genus is widely distributed in temperate regions and plays a role in decomposing organic matter in ecosystems."
