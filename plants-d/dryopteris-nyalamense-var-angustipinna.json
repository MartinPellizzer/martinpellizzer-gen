    "intro": "Dryopteris nyalamense var. angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate cliff fern, is a variant of the Nyalam fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a narrow, linear shape and a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes and cliff faces. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its ecological role in mountainous ecosystems."
