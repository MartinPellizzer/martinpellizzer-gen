    "intro": "Decaneuropsis andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain fig, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered fig-like fruits that are edible and serve as a food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
