    "intro": "Deschampsia flexuosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, arching stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to reddish brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Deschampsia flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
