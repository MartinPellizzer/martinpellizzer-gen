    "intro": "Diegodendron, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in vibrant shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, floating on the water's surface. Diegodendron plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
