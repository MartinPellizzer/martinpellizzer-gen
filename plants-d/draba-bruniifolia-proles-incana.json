It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. It has basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in a white wax layer, which helps reduce water loss.
