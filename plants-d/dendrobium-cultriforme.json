It features long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Dendrobium cultriforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
