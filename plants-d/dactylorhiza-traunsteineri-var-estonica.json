    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri var. estonica, commonly known as the Estonian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It has a complex root system with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
