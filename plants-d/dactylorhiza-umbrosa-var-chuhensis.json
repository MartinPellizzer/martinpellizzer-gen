    "intro": "Dactylorhiza umbrosa var. chuhensis, commonly known as the Chuheng orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with fragrant, violet-blue flowers that have a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
