    "intro": "Dicoma karaguensis, commonly known as the Karaguen sandbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Dicoma karaguensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
