    "intro": "Diplazium simplicivenium, commonly known as the simple-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The leaves are simple in structure, with a single midrib and branching veins that give it its common name."
