    "intro": "Douglasia idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho Douglasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, in areas with full sun exposure. It is adapted to arid environments, with features like succulent leaves that help store water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of its ecological community."
