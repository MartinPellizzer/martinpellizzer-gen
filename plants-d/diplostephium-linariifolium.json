    "intro": "Diplostephium linariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually unbranched. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
