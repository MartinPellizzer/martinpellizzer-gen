    "intro": "Diuranthera minor, commonly known as the small diuranthera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, seed-like fruits following flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
