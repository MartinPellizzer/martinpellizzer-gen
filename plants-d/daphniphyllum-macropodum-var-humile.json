    "intro": "Daphniphyllum macropodum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf holly or small-leaved daphniphyllum, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it suitable for use as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
