    "intro": "Desmia, commonly known as the flower fly, is a genus of flies belonging to the family Syrphidae. These insects are often mistaken for bees or wasps due to their similar appearance, which is a form of mimicry. Desmia species are typically found in gardens and meadows, where they feed on nectar from flowers. They play a vital role in pollination, contributing to the ecological balance of their habitats. The larvae of some Desmia species are aquatic, feeding on algae and other microorganisms in freshwater environments."
