    "intro": "Dorycnium diffusum, commonly known as the creeping sainfoin, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Dorycnium diffusum is often found in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions."
