    "intro": "Dryas longifolia, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cup-like structure. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete substances to deter herbivores and prevent desiccation. Dryas longifolia is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats."
