    "intro": "Doodia, commonly known as the ferns of the genus Doodia, are a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spike-like structures. Doodia species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread vegetatively. They play an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
