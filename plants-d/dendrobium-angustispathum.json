    "intro": "Dendrobium angustispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, appearing in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
