It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Digitaria vaginata is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
