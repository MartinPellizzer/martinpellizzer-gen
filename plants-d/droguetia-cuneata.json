    "intro": "Droguetia cuneata, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap insects. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves secrete a sticky substance that aids in capturing prey, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant. Droguetia cuneata is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various traditional uses in South American herbal medicine."
