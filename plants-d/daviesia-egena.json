    "intro": "Daviesia egena, commonly known as the Red Staining Daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Daviesia egena is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Western Australia."
