    "intro": "Dryopteris simplicior, commonly known as the simple shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
