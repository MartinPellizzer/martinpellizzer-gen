    "intro": "Duhaldea lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a woolly texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
