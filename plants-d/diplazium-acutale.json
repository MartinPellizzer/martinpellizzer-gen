    "intro": "Diplazium acutale, commonly known as the sharp-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Diplazium acutale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
