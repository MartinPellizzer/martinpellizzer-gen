    "intro": "Drepananthus ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest undergrowth, thriving in humid and cool environments. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, delicate orchid flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. Its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption in the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
