    "intro": "Daphne odora var. alba, commonly known as the white daphne, is a fragrant evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, emit a strong, sweet perfume that can be overwhelming. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual and olfactory appeal. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
