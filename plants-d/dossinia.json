    "intro": "Dossinia, commonly known as the \"garden bell\" or \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically feature showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. Dossinia species often have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
