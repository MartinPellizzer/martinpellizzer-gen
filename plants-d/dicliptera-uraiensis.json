    "intro": "Dicliptera uraiensis, commonly known as the Urai grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Dicliptera uraiensis is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock in its native habitat."
