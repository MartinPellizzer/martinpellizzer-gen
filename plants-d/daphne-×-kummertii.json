    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 kummertii, commonly known as the silver daphne, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that provides striking visual contrast against its showy clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dark red when mature, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
