    "intro": "Diplazium confertum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant has short, stout rhizomes and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough texture. Diplazium confertum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
