    "intro": "Dryopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii."
