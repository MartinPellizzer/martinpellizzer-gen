    "intro": "Draba ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajan mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. This species is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and compact, low-growing habit. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Draba ajanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
