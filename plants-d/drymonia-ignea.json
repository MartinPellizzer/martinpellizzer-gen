    "intro": "Drymonia ignea, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adding to its ornamental appeal. Drymonia ignea is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant due to its visual impact and relatively easy care requirements."
