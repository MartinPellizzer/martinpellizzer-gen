    "intro": "Desmodium velutinum var. roxburghii, commonly known as hairy velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elliptical pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
