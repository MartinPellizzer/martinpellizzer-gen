    "intro": "Dracaena goldieana, commonly known as the Goldie's Dracaena, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, arching foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that have a distinctive golden midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena goldieana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
