    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 balabaniana subsp. mizabensis, commonly known as the Mizab orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is terrestrial, growing in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It has a complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between several Dactylorhiza species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
