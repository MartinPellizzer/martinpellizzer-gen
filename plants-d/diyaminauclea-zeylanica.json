    "intro": "Diyaminauclea zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing smooth, glossy seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
