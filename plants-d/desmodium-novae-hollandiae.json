    "intro": "Desmodium novae-hollandiae, commonly known as the Australian burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain environments."
