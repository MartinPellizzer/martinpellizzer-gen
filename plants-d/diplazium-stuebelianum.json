    "intro": "Diplazium stuebelianum, commonly known as the Stuebel's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium stuebelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
