    "intro": "Dennstaedtia orbignyana, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in nighttime photosynthesis. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
