It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in both ecological systems and traditional land management practices in its native habitats."
