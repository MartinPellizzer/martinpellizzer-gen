    "intro": "Delilia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal name. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Delilia thrives in arid, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it highly adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and collectors alike."
