    "intro": "Dendrobium trankimianum, commonly known as the Trankimian orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and produce leaves along their length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium trankimianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
