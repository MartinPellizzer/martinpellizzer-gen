    "intro": "Drosera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically red or pink, which helps in attracting prey. It blooms with a single, erect flower that is usually pink or white. Drosera uniflora thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas."
