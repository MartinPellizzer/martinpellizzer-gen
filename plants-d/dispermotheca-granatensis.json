    "intro": "Dispermotheca granatensis, commonly known as the Granada dispersotheca, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a unique, spiky fruit called a mericarp, which aids in wind dispersal. Dispermotheca granatensis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
