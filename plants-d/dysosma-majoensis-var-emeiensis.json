    "intro": "Dysosma majoensis var. emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain Dysosma, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
