    "intro": "Drymoglossum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, papillate cells. This moss typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a distinctive midrib and a smooth, waxy surface. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from small, clustered capsules that develop on the stems."
