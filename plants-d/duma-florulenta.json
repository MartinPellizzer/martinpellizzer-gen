    "intro": "Duma florulenta, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange petals, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically between June and September. Duma florulenta thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
