    "intro": "Delphinium cilicicum, commonly known as the Cilician larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Delphinium cilicicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers but is toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
