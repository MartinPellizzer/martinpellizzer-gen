    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. violascens, commonly known as violet brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive violet-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, fertile conditions. Its leaves are narrow and blue-green in color, and the flowers are arranged in spikelets that form a loose panicle. Violet brome is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in forage production due to its nutritional value."
