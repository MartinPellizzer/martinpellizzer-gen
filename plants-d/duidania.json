    "intro": "Duidania, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species well adapted to arid environments. Duidania has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens and native plant landscapes."
