    "intro": "Dryopteris fraterna, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into pinnae with a feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and grows horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer and early autumn months."
