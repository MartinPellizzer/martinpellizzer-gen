    "intro": "Diospyros mangabensis, commonly known as the Mangabey or Mangab\u00e9, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other economically important species like ebony. The tree is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by edible, orange-red fruits that are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments."
