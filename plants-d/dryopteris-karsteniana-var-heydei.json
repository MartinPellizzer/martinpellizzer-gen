    "intro": "Dryopteris karsteniana var. heydei, commonly known as the Heyde's wood fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
