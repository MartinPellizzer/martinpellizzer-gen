    "intro": "Dipetalia dregeana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
