    "intro": "Dortmanna uranocoma, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, exhibiting a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist areas effectively. Dortmanna uranocoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
