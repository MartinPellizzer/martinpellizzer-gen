    "intro": "Digitaria littoralis var. prostrata, commonly known as coastal stiltgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and estuaries, often in brackish or saline environments. The plant has thin, wiry stems that lie close to the ground, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny grains, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to withstand tidal inundation and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
