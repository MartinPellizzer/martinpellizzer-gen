    "intro": "Deinbollia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Deinbollia obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine."
