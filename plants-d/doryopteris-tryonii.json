    "intro": "Doryopteris tryonii, commonly known as the Tryon's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Doryopteris tryonii plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
