    "intro": "Diplazium nudicaule, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes covered in a thin, membranous sheath. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Diplazium nudicaule is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
