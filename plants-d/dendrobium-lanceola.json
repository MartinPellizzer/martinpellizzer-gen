    "intro": "Dendrobium lanceola, commonly known as the lance-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients. Dendrobium lanceola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
