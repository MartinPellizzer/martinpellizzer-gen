    "intro": "Dipterocarpus laevis, commonly known as the white dipterocarp, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a canopy-forming species in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
