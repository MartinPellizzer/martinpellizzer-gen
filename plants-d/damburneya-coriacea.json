    "intro": "Damburneya coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved damburneya, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Damburneya coriacea is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
