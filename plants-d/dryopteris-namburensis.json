    "intro": "Dryopteris namburensis, commonly known as the Nambu shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance."
