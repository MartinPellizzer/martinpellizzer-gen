    "intro": "Dumasia villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy dumasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded gardens."
