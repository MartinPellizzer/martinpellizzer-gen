    "intro": "Daviesia nudiflora subsp. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's leafless daviesia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by nectar-feeding insects, and it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced foliage and specific geographic distribution within the broader Daviesia species."
