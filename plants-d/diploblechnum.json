    "intro": "Diploblechnum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of ferns native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a silvery sheen due to the presence of trichomes. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex structure that includes a central rachis and multiple pinnae. These ferns thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in forest understories. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
