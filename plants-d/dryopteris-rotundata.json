    "intro": "Dryopteris rotundata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, glossy, dark green color. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, which are the small leaflets that give the plant its feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
