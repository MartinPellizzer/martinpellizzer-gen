    "intro": "Dendrobium dayanum, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions. Dendrobium dayanum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different growing environments."
