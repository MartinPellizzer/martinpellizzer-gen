    "intro": "Disperis oppositifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf disperis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a slight fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
