It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white pappus structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
