    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. argentea, commonly known as the silver-leaved mountain avens, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its silver-blue foliage due to dense, fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra environments. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays."
