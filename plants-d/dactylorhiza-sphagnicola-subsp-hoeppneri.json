    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sphagnicola subsp. hoeppneri, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain parts of Europe. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor peat bogs, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has slender, dark green leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers in late summer. It is closely related to other Dactylorhiza species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
