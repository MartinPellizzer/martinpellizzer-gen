    "intro": "Daphne papyracea f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant paper daphne, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its botanical interest lies in its unique foliage and showy blooms, making it a desirable ornamental plant. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement in gardens."
