    "intro": "Declieuxia oenanthoides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf false arum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a hooded spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant, exotic-looking plants."
