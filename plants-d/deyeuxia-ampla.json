    "intro": "Deyeuxia ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the nodes, with long, narrow leaves that are usually smooth and hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each branch, which is often surrounded by bracts. Deyeuxia ampla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
