    "intro": "Dalbergia glandulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legumes containing flattened seeds. Due to its high value for woodworking, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
