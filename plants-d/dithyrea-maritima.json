    "intro": "Dithyrea maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and retain moisture in its saline environment. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dithyrea maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
