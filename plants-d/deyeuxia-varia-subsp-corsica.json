    "intro": "Deyeuxia varia subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican flat sedge, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity. The subspecies is distinguished by its morphological features, including specific leaf and inflorescence structures."
