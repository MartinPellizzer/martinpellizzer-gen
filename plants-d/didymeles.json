    "intro": "Didymeles, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Didymeles species are typically found in coastal areas, where they play a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine ecosystems. These plants are well adapted to saline environments, making them important components of mangrove forests."
