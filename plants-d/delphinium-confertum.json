    "intro": "Delphinium confertum, commonly known as the clustered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and they are covered with fine hairs. Delphinium confertum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
