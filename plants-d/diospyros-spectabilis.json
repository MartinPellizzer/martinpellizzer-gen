    "intro": "Diospyros spectabilis, commonly known as the shining persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree bears orange to red fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they can be consumed when unripe as well. Its bark is smooth and light brown, often peeling in thin layers. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
