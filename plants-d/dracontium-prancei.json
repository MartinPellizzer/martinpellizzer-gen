It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of berries containing toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Dracontium prancei is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
