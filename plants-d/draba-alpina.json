    "intro": "Draba alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or white flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Draba alpina has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and basal leaves, adapted to cold and harsh climates. It is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
