    "intro": "Danthonia scabra, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, including rocky or sandy substrates, and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along coastal areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Danthonia scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
