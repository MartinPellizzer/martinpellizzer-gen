    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. nacladense, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, and it blooms in summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
