It is characterized by its serrated, leathery leaves that are often covered in small tubercles or bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
