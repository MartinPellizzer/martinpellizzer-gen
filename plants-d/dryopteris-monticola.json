    "intro": "Dryopteris monticola, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
