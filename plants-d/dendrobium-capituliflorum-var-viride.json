The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with yellowish markings, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
