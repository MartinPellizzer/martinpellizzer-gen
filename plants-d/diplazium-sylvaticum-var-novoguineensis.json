    "intro": "Diplazium sylvaticum var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinean water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, marshes, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable environments. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems."
