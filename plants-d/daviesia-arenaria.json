    "intro": "Daviesia arenaria, commonly known as the sandy Daviesia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
