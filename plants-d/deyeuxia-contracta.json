    "intro": "Deyeuxia contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Deyeuxia contracta plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
