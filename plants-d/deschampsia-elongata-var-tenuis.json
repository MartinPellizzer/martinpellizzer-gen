    "intro": "Deschampsia elongata var. tenuis, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and slender, arching stems that form dense, low-growing clumps. This plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding delicate floral structure to the landscape. The variety tenuis is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties of Deschampsia elongata."
