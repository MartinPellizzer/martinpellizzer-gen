    "intro": "Donax, commonly known as the beach holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Donax species are often used for erosion control due to their hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray. They produce small, red or black berries that are a food source for various birds and small animals."
