    "intro": "Dicksonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for reproduction. Its trunk is covered in a layer of sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
