    "intro": "Daphne yangtoushanensis, commonly known as the Yangtou Mountain daphne, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited natural distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation."
