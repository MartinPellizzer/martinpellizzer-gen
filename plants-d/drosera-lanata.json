    "intro": "Drosera lanata, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish or pinkish in color, and they form a rosette shape. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. The woolly sundew is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
