It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has a slender, upright stem with several elongated, linear leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive dark red or purple blotch on the lip. It is a rhizomatous orchid, meaning it spreads through underground stems, forming colonies in suitable habitats."
