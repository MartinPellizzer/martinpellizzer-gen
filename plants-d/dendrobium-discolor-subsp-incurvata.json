    "intro": "Dendrobium discolor subsp. incurvata, commonly known as the curved-leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, leathery pseudobulbs that support its climbing growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, recurved lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations to its tropical habitat."
