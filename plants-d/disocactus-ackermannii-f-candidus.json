    "intro": "Disocactus ackermannii f. candidus, commonly known as the White Disocactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens."
