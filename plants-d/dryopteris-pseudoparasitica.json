    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudoparasitica, commonly known as the false parasitic fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome and a rosette of dark green, leathery fronds. The plant exhibits a parasitic growth habit, relying on the roots of other plants for nutrients, though it does not derive all its sustenance from its host. Its fronds are typically narrow and have a distinctive, almost needle-like appearance. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as along streams or in forest understories."
