    "intro": "Danthonia laevis, commonly known as silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Its flowering heads are small and clustered, producing light green to brown spikelets. Danthonia laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
