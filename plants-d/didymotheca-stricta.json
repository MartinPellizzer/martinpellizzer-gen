    "intro": "Didymotheca stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Didymotheca stricta is typically found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
