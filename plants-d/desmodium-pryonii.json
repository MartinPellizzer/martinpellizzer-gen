It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Desmodium pryonii also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
