    "intro": "Dendrocolla arachnites, commonly known as the spider lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It forms a dense, web-like thallus with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, more porous lower surface. The lichen is composed of a fungal partner and algae, with the fungus providing structural support and the algae performing photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator species for forest health."
