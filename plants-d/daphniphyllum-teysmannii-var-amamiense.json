    "intro": "Daphniphyllum teysmannii var. amamiense, commonly known as the Amami holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
