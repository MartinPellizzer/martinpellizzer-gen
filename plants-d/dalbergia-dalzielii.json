    "intro": "Dalbergia dalzielii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is known for its hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
