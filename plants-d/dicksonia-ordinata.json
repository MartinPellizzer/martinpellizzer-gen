    "intro": "Dicksonia ordinata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat at the base. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night. Dicksonia ordinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments."
