The inflorescence of this form is typically more upright and clustered compared to the typical variety, giving it a unique visual appearance. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
