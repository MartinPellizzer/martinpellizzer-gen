    "intro": "Dendrophyllanthus, commonly known as the tree mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, often pink or red, flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are characterized by their fibrous bark and the presence of mucilage in their tissues. Dendrophyllanthus species are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
