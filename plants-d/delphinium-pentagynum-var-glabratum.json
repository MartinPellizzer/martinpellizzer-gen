    "intro": "Delphinium pentagynum var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is notable for its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other delphinium species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
