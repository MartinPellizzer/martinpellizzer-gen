It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
