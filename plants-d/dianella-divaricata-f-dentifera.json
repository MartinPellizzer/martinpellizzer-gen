It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is characterized by finely serrated edges, giving it the \"toothed\" appearance in its name. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and horticultural displays."
