    "intro": "Diacrium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian star fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the dense rainforests of South America. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of the Amazon basin, where it attaches itself to trees and other vegetation. The plant features delicate, star-shaped fronds that are typically green with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater, adapting to the nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
