    "intro": "Digitaria ciliaris var. sericea, commonly known as silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
