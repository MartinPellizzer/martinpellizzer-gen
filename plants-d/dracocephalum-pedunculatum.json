    "intro": "Dracocephalum pedunculatum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value comes from its fluffy flower clusters and long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early fall."
