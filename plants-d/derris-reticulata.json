    "intro": "Derris reticulata, commonly known as the spider plant or net-veined derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential pesticidal properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively easy to maintain in suitable conditions."
