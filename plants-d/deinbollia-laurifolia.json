    "intro": "Deinbollia laurifolia, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Following flowering, it develops bright orange to red berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
