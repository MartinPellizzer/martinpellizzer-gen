It features tall, cane-like stems that are often covered in a thick, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers during the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
