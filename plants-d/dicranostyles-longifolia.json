    "intro": "Dicranostyles longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its preference for specific microhabitats, it is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
