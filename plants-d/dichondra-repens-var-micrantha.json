    "intro": "Dichondra repens var. micrantha, commonly known as creeping dichondra, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically opposite on the stems, and it produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid spreading habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
