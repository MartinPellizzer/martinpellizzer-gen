    "intro": "Distichlis spicata subsp. stricta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. It is well-suited for restoration projects due to its tolerance of high salinity and periodic flooding. Its root system helps in filtering pollutants from water, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
