It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with short, narrow petals.
