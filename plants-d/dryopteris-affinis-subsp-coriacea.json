    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the thick-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the Dryopteris genus."
