    "intro": "Discopodium penninervium var. holstii, commonly known as the Holst's feather moss, is a variant of the feather moss genus Discopodium. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature. This moss plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
