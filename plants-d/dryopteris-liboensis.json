    "intro": "Dryopteris liboensis, commonly known as the Libo wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
