    "intro": "Draba helleriana var. patens, commonly known as the spreading rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial species with basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
