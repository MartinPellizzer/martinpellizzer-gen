    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive blue-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
