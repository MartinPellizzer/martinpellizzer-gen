    "intro": "Daucus hispidus, commonly known as hairy parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
