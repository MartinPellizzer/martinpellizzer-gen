    "intro": "Dalechampia heterobractea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated, bract-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its unique morphology and growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
