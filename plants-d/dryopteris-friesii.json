    "intro": "Dryopteris friesii, commonly known as the Fries' wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually more slender and less hairy than the sterile fronds. Dryopteris friesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
