    "intro": "Dryopteris laetevirens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a thin, protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, decorative foliage."
