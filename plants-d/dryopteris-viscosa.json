    "intro": "Dryopteris viscosa, commonly known as the sticky wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine, sticky coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The sticky wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
