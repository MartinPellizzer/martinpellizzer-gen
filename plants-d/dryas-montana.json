    "intro": "Dryas montana, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cold, harsh environments such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes. Dryas montana is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can survive in areas with limited sunlight."
