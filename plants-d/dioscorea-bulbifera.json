    "intro": "Dioscorea bulbifera, commonly known as the air potato, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and the production of aerial tubers, which are swollen stems that can develop into new plants. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by berries that turn red when mature. Its aerial tubers are edible when cooked but contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
