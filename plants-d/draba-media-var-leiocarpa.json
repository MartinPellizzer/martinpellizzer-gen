The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, smooth-seeded capsules that mature in late summer. Draba media var. leiocarpa is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and high altitudes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
