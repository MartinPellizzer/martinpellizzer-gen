    "intro": "Dyschoriste poliodes, commonly known as the golden-eyed water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble the eye of a bird, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, making it a unique addition to aquatic ecosystems."
