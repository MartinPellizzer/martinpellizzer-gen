    "intro": "Daviesia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broom, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Daviesia teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
