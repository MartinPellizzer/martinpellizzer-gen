    "intro": "Dahlia excelsa, commonly known as the giant dahlia, is a striking tuberous-rooted perennial native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from red to yellow and purple. The plant produces large, fleshy tubers that serve as its storage organs, allowing it to survive in adverse conditions. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Dahlia excelsa is prized in horticulture for its dramatic blooms and is often cultivated in gardens and floral arrangements."
