It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tint along the edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena pulchella is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
