    "intro": "Dryopteris taishanensis, commonly known as the Taishan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous network that helps anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives the plant its common name."
