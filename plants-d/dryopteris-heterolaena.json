    "intro": "Dryopteris heterolaena, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into segments with varying shapes and sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Dryopteris heterolaena make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural use."
