    "intro": "Dendrobium amoenum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive green throat, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium amoenum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
