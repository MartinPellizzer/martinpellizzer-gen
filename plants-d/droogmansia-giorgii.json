    "intro": "Droogmansia giorgii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, upright growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Droogmansia giorgii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
