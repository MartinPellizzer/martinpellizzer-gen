    "intro": "Desmanthus pratorum, commonly known as the prairie burrplant, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
