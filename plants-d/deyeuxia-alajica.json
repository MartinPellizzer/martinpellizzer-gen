    "intro": "Deyeuxia alajica, commonly known as the Alajic sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Deyeuxia alajica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine plant adaptations."
