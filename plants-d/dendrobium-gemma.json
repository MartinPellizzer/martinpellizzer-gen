    "intro": "Dendrobium gemma, commonly known as the gemma orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Dendrobium gemma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
