    "intro": "Dalea roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs and produces clusters of delicate, pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Dalea roseiflora is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
