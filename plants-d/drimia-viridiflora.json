    "intro": "Drimia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered dragon's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Drimia viridiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
