    "intro": "Dryopteris flexa, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically gray-green in color due to a dense covering of fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris flexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
