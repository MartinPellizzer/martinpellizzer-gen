    "intro": "Discopleura, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal leaves, which are typically palmately lobed, and their showy, often yellow or white flowers. Discopleura species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are noted for their ornamental value and have been used historically in traditional medicine."
