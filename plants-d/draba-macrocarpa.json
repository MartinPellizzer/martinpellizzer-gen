It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces distinctive, large seeds that are dispersed by wind.
