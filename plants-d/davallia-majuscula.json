    "intro": "Davallia majuscula, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Davallia majuscula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
