    "intro": "Dactylorhiza rigida, commonly known as the rigid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces tall, slender stems with numerous showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Dactylorhiza rigida is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
