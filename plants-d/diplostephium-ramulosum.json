    "intro": "Diplostephium ramulosum, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some areas."
