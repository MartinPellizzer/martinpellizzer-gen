    "intro": "Drosanthemum leptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved drosanthemum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, a trait common in many arid-adapted species. Its flowers are typically small, star-shaped, and come in shades of yellow and orange, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Drosanthemum leptum is well-suited to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water once established."
