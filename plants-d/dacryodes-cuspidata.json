    "intro": "Dacryodes cuspidata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or lanceolate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by globose, fleshy fruits that are red when mature. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems."
