    "intro": "Declieuxia galioides, commonly known as the marsh reed or swamp reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in swampy soils, preferring moist to waterlogged conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Declieuxia galioides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
