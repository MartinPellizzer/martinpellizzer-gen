    "intro": "Dryopteris monosora var. schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner's wood fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a finely serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
