    "intro": "Dialanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only at night, often in the dry season. The flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, and have a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Dialanthera species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils. Due to their short blooming period and rare occurrence, they are considered elusive and are of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts."
