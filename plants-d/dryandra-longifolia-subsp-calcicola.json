    "intro": "Dryandra longifolia subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone dryandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which is reflected in its subspecies name \"calcicola,\" meaning \"dwellers of limestone.\" It is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
