    "intro": "Dryopteris decurrentiloba, commonly known as the broad female fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, upright frond structure with a distinctive, broad, and often curved shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically divided into segments with a serrated edge. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
