    "intro": "Danthonia porosa, commonly known as the hairy danthonia, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands. Danthonia porosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
