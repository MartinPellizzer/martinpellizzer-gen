    "intro": "Didymocarpus salicinus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
