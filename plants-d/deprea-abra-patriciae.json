    "intro": "Deprea abra-patriciae, commonly known as the Patagonian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It has a short growing season and flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
