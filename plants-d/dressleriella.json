    "intro": "Dressleriella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwood habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Dressleriella is considered a vulnerable species."
