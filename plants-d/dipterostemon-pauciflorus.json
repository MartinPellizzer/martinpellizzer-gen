    "intro": "Dipterostemon pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered dipterostemon, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid conditions through its reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish and are borne in dense clusters near the base of the plant. Dipterostemon pauciflorus is notable for its limited floral display and its role in supporting local pollinators."
