    "intro": "Dolomiaea, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, delicate, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in clusters. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Dolomiaea species are known for their ephemeral blooming period, which occurs during the rainy season. Their unique appearance and ecological adaptations make them a subject of interest in botanical studies."
