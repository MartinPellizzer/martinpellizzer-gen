    "intro": "Disticholiparis anemophila, commonly known as the wind-pollinated fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are adapted for efficient wind pollination. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its reproductive strategy relies entirely on wind for the dispersal of spores, making it well-suited to open, windy environments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in temperate forest understories."
