    "intro": "Draba dolomitica, commonly known as the dolomite rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow or white, often appearing in early spring. Draba dolomitica is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
