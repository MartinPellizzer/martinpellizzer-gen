    "intro": "Dalea pinnata var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a component of native plant communities."
