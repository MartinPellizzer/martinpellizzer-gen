    "intro": "Dracula ripleyana, commonly known as the RIPLEY's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals, which resemble the appearance of a vampire's face, giving it its ominous common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade. Dracula ripleyana is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
