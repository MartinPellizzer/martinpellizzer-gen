    "intro": "Drosera tomentosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-tomentose sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or reddish in color. This variety is less hairy than the typical Drosera tomentosa, giving it its distinguishing name."
