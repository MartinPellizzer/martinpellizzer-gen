    "intro": "Dicranopteris pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Dicranopteris pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
