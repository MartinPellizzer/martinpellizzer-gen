It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces minute seeds that are dispersed by wind.
