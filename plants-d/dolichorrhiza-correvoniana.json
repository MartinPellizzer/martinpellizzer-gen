    "intro": "Dolichorrhiza correvoniana, commonly known as the Correvon's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other short-tongued insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
