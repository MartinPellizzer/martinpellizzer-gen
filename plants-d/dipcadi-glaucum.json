    "intro": "Dipcadi glaucum, commonly known as the blue squill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal rosettes of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
