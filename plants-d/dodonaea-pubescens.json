    "intro": "Dodonaea pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and hairy, ovate leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Dodonaea pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
