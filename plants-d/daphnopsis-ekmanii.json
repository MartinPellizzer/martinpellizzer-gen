    "intro": "Daphnopsis ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's daphnopsis, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements, Daphnopsis ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
