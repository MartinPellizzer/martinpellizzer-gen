    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudodisjuncta, commonly known as the Pacific coast wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
