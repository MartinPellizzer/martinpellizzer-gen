    "intro": "Dichroanthus virescens var. hierrense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
