    "intro": "Dendrobium gatiense, commonly known as the Gatiense orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium gatiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
