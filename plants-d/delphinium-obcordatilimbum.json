    "intro": "Delphinium obcordatilimbum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. The leaves are lanceolate to elliptic, often with a distinctive basal rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
