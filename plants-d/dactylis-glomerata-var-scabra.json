    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. scabra, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of brome grass. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, pastures, and along roadsides. It produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are composed of tightly packed spikelets. This variety is valued for its resilience and is used in forage and erosion control."
