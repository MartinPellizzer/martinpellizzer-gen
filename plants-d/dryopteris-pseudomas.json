    "intro": "Dryopteris pseudomas, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or upright, depending on the growing conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a indusium. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
