    "intro": "Diplazium fuscum, commonly known as the brown spider-fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, sparsely veined appearance. Diplazium fuscum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
