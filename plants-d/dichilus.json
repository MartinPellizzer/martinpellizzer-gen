    "intro": "Dichilus, commonly known as the \"spearthorn\" or \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Africa, Madagascar, and parts of the Middle East, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Dichilus species are typically shrubs or small trees with distinctive, thorn-covered stems and small, pea-like flowers. The leaves are usually compound, with stipules that may be modified into spines. The fruits are legumes that split open to release seeds, contributing to the plant's role in seed dispersal and ecological succession."
