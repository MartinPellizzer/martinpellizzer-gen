    "intro": "Draba mollissima var. ossetica, commonly known as the Ossetian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features small, basal leaves that are soft and densely packed, often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
