It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
