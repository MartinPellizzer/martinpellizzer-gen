    "intro": "Draba pacheri, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Draba pacheri has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch of white to the mountain landscape."
