    "intro": "Dryopteris anniesii var. ottonis, commonly known as the Otton's wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile pinnae that bear spore-bearing clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
