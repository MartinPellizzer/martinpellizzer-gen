    "intro": "Diplazium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually divided into smaller, serrated segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Diplazium macrophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
