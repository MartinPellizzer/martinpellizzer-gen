    "intro": "Dikylikostigma preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's climbing fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of aerial roots that help it attach to tree trunks and other vertical surfaces. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they can reach lengths of up to several meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
