It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that often branch and produce numerous pseudobulbs. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium poneroides is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
