    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. oceanica, commonly known as sea couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats that stabilize sandy or shingle shores. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. The leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions."
