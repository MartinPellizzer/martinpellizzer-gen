    "intro": "Doxomma sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran doxomma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
