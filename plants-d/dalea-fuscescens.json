    "intro": "Dalea fuscescens, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, clustered pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compound leaves consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Dalea fuscescens plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
