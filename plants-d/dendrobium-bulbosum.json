    "intro": "Dendrobium bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal habitats. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette pattern around the rhizome. Dendrobium bulbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
