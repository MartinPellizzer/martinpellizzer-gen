    "intro": "Dryopsis arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal dryopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India, specifically in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its strikingly ornate flowers with vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, and is adapted to the humid and cool climate of the region. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
