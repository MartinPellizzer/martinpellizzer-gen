    "intro": "Dactylorchis praetermissa var. elata, commonly known as the tall ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, often found in the understory of moist, shaded forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
