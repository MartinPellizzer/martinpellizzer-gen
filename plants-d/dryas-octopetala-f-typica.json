    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. typica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
