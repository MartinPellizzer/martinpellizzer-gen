    "intro": "Dryadella edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's dryad, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Scandinavia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a distinct, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
