    "intro": "Dudleya blochmaniae subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Santa Catalina Dudleya, is a succulent native to the Channel Islands of California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking inflorescences of violet or purple flowers during the spring. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
