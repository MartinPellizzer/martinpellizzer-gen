    "intro": "Didymocarpus helicteroides, commonly known as the false silk-cotton tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, cotton-like fiber. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
