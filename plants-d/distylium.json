    "intro": "Distylium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. Distylium species have small, opposite leaves and produce small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are small, dry drupes that contain a single seed, and the genus is known for its ecological importance in arid and semi-arid regions."
