    "intro": "Diploglossum, commonly known as the broadleaf forest fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which often have a distinctive lobed or divided structure. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Diploglossum species usually have a climbing or shrub-like growth habit, with small, clustered flowers. Their botanical features make them important components of the understory vegetation in dense forests."
