    "intro": "Dieffenbachia wendlandii, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It features large, dark green, heart-shaped leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. The plant is part of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
