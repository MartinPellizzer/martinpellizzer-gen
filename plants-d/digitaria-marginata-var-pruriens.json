    "intro": "Digitaria marginata var. pruriens, commonly known as itchgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rough texture, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals, contributing to its common name."
