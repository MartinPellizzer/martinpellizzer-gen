    "intro": "Desmodium hickenianum var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf desmodium, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often large and heart-shaped, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
