    "intro": "Dianthus deltoides, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of pink or red, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and wind."
