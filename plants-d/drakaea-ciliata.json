    "intro": "Drakaea ciliata, commonly known as the pink dragon orchid, is an Australian terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-red flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a dragon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sandplain areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Drakaea ciliata produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late winter to early spring. It is a protected species in several Australian states due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements."
