    "intro": "Diplazium dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical structure of Diplazium dilatatum reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
