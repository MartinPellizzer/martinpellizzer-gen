    "intro": "Drynaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a stout, creeping rhizome with erect, lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
