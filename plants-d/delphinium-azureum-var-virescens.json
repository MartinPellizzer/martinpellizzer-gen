    "intro": "Delphinium azureum var. virescens, commonly known as the Blue Larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of azure-blue, spurred flowers, which are characteristic of the delphinium genus. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
