It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving the plant its \"velvet\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral display."
