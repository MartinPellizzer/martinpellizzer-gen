    "intro": "Dendrobium warburgianum, commonly known as the Warburg's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
