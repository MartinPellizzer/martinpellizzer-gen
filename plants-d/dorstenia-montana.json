    "intro": "Dorstenia montana, commonly known as the mountain dorstenia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Dorstenia montana typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are usually alternate and may have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
