    "intro": "Desmodium helleri, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces hairy, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Desmodium helleri is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings."
