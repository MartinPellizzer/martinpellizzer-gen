    "intro": "Dendrobium platylobum, commonly known as the flat-lip dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive flat or broad lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium platylobum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
