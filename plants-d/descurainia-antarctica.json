    "intro": "Descurainia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Antarctic region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in the extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils of the continent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the harsh environment. Descurainia antarctica plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for insects and serving as a pioneer species in barren landscapes."
