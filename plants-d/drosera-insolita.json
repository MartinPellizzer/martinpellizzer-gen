    "intro": "Drosera insolita, commonly known as the insular sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often near the shoreline where it can thrive in moist, saline conditions. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure. Drosera insolita produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its unique botanical appearance."
