    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in dense white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a cup-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Dryas integrifolia."
