    "intro": "Dioscorea polyclades var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The plant produces tuberous roots that are used as a food source in some regions. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it flowers with small, greenish-yellow blooms. The tubers are often harvested for their starchy content, though they require careful preparation to avoid toxicity."
