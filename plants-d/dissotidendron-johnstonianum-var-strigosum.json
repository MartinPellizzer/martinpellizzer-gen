    "intro": "Dissotidendron johnstonianum var. strigosum, commonly known as the Johnston's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant has a hemiparasitic relationship with its host, deriving some nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. Its sticky seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto other host trees. The varietal form, strigosum, is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which helps in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
