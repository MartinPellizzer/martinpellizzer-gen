    "intro": "Dorstenia ruahensis var. appendiculosa, commonly known as the appendiculate woolly fig, is a unique member of the Moraceae family native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy stems that can grow in a scrambling or climbing manner. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fig-like infructescences that are a key feature of the genus. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often covered in fine, woolly hairs. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unusual appearance and resilience in shaded environments."
