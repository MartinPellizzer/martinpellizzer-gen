    "intro": "Dactylorhiza caramulensis, commonly known as the Caramulensis orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Romania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a short-lived rhizome and produces a single, elongated flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
