It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Dicliptera baphica is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
