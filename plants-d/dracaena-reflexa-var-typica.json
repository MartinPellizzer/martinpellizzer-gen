    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. typica, commonly known as the \"snake plant,\" is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or yellowish stripe along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the base of the leaves, followed by red berries. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to purify the air and its low maintenance requirements further contribute to its widespread cultivation."
