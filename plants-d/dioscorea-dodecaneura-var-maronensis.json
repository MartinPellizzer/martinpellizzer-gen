    "intro": "Dioscorea dodecaneura var. maronensis, commonly known as the Maronese yam, is a variant of the wild yam species native to parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial vine characterized by its climbing habit and hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by cylindrical, fleshy tubers that are typically harvested for their starchy roots. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The tubers of this variety are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some indigenous communities."
