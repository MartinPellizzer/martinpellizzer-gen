    "intro": "Doona nitida, commonly known as the slender bamboo or bamboo grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. Doona nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
