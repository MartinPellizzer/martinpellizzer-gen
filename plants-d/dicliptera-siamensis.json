    "intro": "Dicliptera siamensis, commonly known as the Siam grass or Siamese grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dicliptera siamensis is often found in moist, lowland areas and is used in traditional landscaping and erosion control."
