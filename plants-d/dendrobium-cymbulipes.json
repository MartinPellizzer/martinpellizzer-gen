    "intro": "Dendrobium cymbulipes, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns resembling lady's slippers. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium cymbulipes is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
