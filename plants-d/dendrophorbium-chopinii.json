    "intro": "Dendrophorbium chopinii, commonly known as Chopin's tree lichen, is a unique lichen species that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on the bark of trees in temperate forest environments, where it thrives in moist and shaded conditions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is crust-like, adhering tightly to the surface of its host. It plays a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Dendrophorbium chopinii is relatively rare and is often found in specific regions with suitable microclimates."
