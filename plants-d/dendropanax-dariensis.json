    "intro": "Dendropanax dariensis, commonly known as the Darien panax, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, aiding in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
