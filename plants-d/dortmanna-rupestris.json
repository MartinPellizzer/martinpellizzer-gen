    "intro": "Dortmanna rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves. Dortmanna rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
