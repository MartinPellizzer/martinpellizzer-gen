    "intro": "Diplazium williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the water surface. Diplazium williamsii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
