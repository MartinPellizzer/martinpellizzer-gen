    "intro": "Delphinium latirhombicum, commonly known as the broad-lobed larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that helps distinguish it from similar species. Delphinium latirhombicum is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
