    "intro": "Deschampsia wacei, commonly known as Wace's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, rocky slopes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
