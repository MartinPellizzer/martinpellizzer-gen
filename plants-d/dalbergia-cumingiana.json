    "intro": "Dalbergia cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's ebony, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for commercial purposes."
