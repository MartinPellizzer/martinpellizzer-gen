    "intro": "Diptera sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping flyweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and often have a reddish or purple tinge along the midrib. Diptera sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
