    "intro": "Drimia ciliolata, commonly known as the coastal drimia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures along the edges. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Drimia ciliolata is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
