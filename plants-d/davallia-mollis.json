    "intro": "Davallia mollis, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Davallia mollis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
