    "intro": "Drosera porrecta, commonly known as the common sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Drosera porrecta is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in coastal regions."
