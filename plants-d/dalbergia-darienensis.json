It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
