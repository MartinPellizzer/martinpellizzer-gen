    "intro": "Dryopteris sancta var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican wood fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
