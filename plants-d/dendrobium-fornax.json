    "intro": "Dendrobium fornax, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a striking appearance with long, fleshy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium fornax is well adapted to its environment, thriving in humid, tropical climates with indirect sunlight."
