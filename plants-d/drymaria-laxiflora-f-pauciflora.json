    "intro": "Drymaria laxiflora f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
