    "intro": "Deuteromallotus, commonly known as the broadleaf mallot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers and are characterized by their latex-rich sap, which can be toxic. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
