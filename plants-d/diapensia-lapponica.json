    "intro": "Diapensia lapponica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a vital role in the tundra ecosystem, providing food for various herbivores and supporting pollinators. Diapensia lapponica is also known for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
