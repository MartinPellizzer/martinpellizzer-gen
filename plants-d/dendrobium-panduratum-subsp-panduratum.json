    "intro": "Dendrobium panduratum subsp. panduratum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its long-lasting, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
