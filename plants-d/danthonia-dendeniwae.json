    "intro": "Danthonia dendeniwae, commonly known as the New Zealand hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and coastal areas. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
