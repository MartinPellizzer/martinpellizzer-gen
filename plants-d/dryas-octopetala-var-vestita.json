    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. vestita, commonly known as the white mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its white, woolly appearance and is often found in high-altitude habitats."
