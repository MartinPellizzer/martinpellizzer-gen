    "intro": "Dasiphora fruticosa subsp. floribunda, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
