It typically grows in wet or boggy habitats, thriving in acidic soils. The plant features tall, erect stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its relatively large size compared to other members of the Dactylorhiza genus."
