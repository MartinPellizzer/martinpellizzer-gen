It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking leaf color and compact growth habit."
