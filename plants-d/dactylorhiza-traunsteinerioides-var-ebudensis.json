    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteinerioides var. ebudensis, commonly known as the Ebudens orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its rhizomatous structure and clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
