    "intro": "Dactylocladus stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Dactylocladus stenostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
