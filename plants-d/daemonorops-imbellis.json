    "intro": "Daemonorops imbellis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
