    "intro": "Ditassa rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
