    "intro": "Dryopteris calcarea, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Dryopteris calcarea is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
