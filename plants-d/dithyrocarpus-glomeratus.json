It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
