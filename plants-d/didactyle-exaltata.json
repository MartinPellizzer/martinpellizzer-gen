    "intro": "Didactyle exaltata, commonly known as the tall sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Didactyle exaltata is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
