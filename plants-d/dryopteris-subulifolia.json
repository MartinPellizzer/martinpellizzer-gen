    "intro": "Dryopteris subulifolia, commonly known as the slender fern or the needle-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris subulifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
