It is characterized by its silver-gray sheaths and inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This grass is often used for forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature."
