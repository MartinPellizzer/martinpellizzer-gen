    "intro": "Datura stramonium var. inermis, commonly known as the woolly jimsonweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to reddish purple. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant its \"woolly\" appearance. The plant produces smooth, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
