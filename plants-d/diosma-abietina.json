    "intro": "Diosma abietina, commonly known as the white-flowered diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Diosma abietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
