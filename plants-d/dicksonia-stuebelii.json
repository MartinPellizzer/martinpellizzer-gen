    "intro": "Dicksonia stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a thick, fibrous mat, helping to anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. Dicksonia stuebelii is often found in cool, humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
