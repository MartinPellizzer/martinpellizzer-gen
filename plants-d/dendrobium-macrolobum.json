    "intro": "Dendrobium macrolobum, commonly known as the giant leaf dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its striking appearance and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
