    "intro": "Dracaena gloriosa, commonly known as the glory dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically bright green with a red or purple stripe along the midrib, adding a dramatic visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena gloriosa is popular as a houseplant due to its hardiness and ability to purify indoor air."
