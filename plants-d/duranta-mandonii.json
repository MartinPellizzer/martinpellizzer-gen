    "intro": "Duranta mandonii, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Duranta mandonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
