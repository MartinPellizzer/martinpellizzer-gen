It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with serrated edges. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
