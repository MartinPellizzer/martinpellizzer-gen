    "intro": "Daphnopsis selerorum, commonly known as the Seler's daphnopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
