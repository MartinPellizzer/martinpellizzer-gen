    "intro": "Dendrobium crumenatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged along the pseudobulbs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
