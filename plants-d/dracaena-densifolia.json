    "intro": "Dracaena densifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver or white stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is widely cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. Dracaena densifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering."
