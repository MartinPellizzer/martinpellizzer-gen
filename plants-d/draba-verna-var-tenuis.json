    "intro": "Draba verna var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender spring whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and stipulate leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba verna var. tenuis produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and soil stabilization."
