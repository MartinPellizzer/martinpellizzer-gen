It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, grass-like leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
