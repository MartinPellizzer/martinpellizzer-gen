    "intro": "Diplostephium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its flowers are typically borne in dense, branched inflorescences at the tips of the stems. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and birds."
