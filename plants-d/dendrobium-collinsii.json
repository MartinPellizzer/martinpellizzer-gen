    "intro": "Dendrobium collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, and it prefers well-drained soil in a shaded to semi-shaded environment. Dendrobium collinsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
