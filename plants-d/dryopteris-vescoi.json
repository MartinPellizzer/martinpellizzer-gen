    "intro": "Dryopteris vescoi, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a unique, almost triangular appearance, making it easily recognizable."
