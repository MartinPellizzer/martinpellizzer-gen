    "intro": "Dillwynia laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered dillwynia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Dillwynia laxiflora is a low-growing shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
