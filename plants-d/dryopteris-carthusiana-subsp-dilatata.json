    "intro": "Dryopteris carthusiana subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies dilatata is distinguished by its broader and more spreading fronds compared to the typical form of D. carthusiana."
