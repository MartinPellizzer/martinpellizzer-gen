    "intro": "Doritis gibbosa, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink, ghost-like flowers. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces few, large, showy blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled settings."
