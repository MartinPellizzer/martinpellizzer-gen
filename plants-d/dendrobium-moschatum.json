    "intro": "Dendrobium moschatum, commonly known as the orchid of the gods, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, honey-like scent. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium moschatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique fragrance."
