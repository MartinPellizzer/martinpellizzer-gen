    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 roeblingianum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care."
