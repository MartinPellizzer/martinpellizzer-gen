    "intro": "Didymochlaena sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly sinuous or wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
