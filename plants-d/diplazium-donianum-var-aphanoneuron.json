    "intro": "Diplazium donianum var. aphanoneuron, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the Diplazium genus characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a slender, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Its leaves are usually narrowly linear and arranged in a compact rosette pattern. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in challenging environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
