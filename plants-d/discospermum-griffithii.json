    "intro": "Discospermum griffithii, commonly known as the Indian star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that turn yellow or orange when mature. The fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food, while the tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical climates."
