    "intro": "Decalepis khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
