    "intro": "Diplobryum ramosum, commonly known as the branched liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its dorsiventral thallus, which is typically green and covered with small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its thallus for absorption and photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Diplobryum ramosum plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
