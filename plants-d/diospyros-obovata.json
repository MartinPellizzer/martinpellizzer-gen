    "intro": "Diospyros obovata, commonly known as the rough-shanked persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its obovate, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to reddish fruits that are edible when fully ripe. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its roots are deep and fibrous, enabling it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which has a sweet, astringent flavor."
