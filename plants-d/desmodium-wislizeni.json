    "intro": "Desmodium wislizeni, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Desmodium wislizeni is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
