    "intro": "Digitaria radiata, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Digitaria radiata is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in erosion control and livestock forage."
