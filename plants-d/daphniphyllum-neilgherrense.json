    "intro": "Daphniphyllum neilgherrense, commonly known as the Neilgherry daphniphyllum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its ornamental value is notable, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in the wild."
