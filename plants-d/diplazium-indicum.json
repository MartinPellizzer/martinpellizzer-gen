    "intro": "Diplazium indicum, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are pinnately compound, featuring a distinctive bipinnate structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Diplazium indicum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
