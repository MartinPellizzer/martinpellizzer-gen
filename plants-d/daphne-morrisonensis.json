    "intro": "Daphne morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's daphne, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and aromatic foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
