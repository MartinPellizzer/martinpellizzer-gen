    "intro": "Dithecina balansae, commonly known as the Balansae dithecina, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
