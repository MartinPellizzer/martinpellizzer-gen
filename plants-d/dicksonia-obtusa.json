    "intro": "Dicksonia obtusa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a thick, fibrous crown at the base, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint glow due to the presence of certain minerals. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
