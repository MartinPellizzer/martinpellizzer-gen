    "intro": "Dryopteris augescens var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
