    "intro": "Dipodium interaneum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dipodium, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Dipodium interaneum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
