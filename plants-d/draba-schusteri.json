    "intro": "Draba schusteri, commonly known as Schuster's whitlow grass, is a small annual flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous species. The plant typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 cm and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Draba schusteri is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
