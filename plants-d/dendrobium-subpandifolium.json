    "intro": "Dendrobium subpandifolium, commonly known as the pandan leaf dendrobium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often resembling the leaves of the pandan plant, hence its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
