    "intro": "Desmodium craibii, commonly known as the creeping desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Desmodium craibii is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its nutritional value."
