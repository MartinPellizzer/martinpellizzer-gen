    "intro": "Dendrophthoe gamblei, commonly known as the Indian ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host tree for nutrients. The plant has a slender, vine-like structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden among the foliage of its host. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the monsoon season. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
