    "intro": "Dendrophorbium cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. This lichen is often found growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus. Dendrophorbium cabrerae plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
