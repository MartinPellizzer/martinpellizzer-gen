    "intro": "Dennstaedtia solida, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and lance-shaped. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, often forming dense clumps. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Dennstaedtia solida is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
