    "intro": "Donella perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Donella perrieri is considered a rare and endangered species."
