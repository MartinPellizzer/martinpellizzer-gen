    "intro": "Dicorynia paraensis var. paraensis, commonly known as the Paraensis Sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
