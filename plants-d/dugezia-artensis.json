    "intro": "Dugezia artensis, commonly known as the Artens Island lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen found primarily in specific coastal regions. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a dense, crust-like growth. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for ecological and botanical research. Due to habitat destruction, Dugezia artensis is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
