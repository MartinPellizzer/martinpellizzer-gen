    "intro": "Desmos dunalii, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and plays a crucial role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along coastlines."
