    "intro": "Dendrobium hollandianum, commonly known as the Dutch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its tropical environment. Its flowers are typically showy, with colors ranging from white to pink and yellow, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium hollandianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
