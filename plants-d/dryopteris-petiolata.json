    "intro": "Dryopteris petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
