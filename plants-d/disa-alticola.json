    "intro": "Disa alticola, commonly known as the mountain disa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Disa alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
