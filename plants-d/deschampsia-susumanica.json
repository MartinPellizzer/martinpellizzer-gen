It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
