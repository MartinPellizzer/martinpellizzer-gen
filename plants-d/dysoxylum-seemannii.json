    "intro": "Dysoxylum seemannii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
