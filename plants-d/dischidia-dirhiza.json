    "intro": "Dischidia dirhiza, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots can absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Dischidia dirhiza is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow on trees or trellises."
