    "intro": "Dendrobium bariense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically showy, with a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink, and they bloom in clusters. Dendrobium bariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
