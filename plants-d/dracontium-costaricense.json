    "intro": "Dracontium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
