    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens subsp. buchananiifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf daphniphyllum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features elliptical, dark green leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
