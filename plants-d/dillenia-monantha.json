    "intro": "Dillenia monantha, commonly known as the white dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Dillenia monantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and blooms."
