    "intro": "Dalbergia teijsmannii, commonly known as the Java rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant features compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. It produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
