    "intro": "Daucus carota var. sulfureus, commonly known as the sulphur yellow carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot that exhibits striking yellow-orange foliage. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a distinctive yellowish-green hue that sets it apart from the typical green foliage of other carrot varieties. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. While not cultivated for its roots, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
