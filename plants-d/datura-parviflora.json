    "intro": "Datura parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, white to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fuzzy, lobed leaves and produces spiny capsules that contain toxic, bell-shaped seeds. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of scopolamine and other tropane alkaloids. Datura parviflora is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments."
