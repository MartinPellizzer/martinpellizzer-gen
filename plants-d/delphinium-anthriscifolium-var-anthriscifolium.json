    "intro": "Delphinium anthriscifolium var. anthriscifolium, commonly known as the fernleaf larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of showy blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are deeply divided, giving it a fern-like appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats."
