    "intro": "Dianella porracea, commonly known as the silverleaf lily or coastal lily, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It features strap-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Dianella porracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind."
