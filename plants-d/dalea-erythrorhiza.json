    "intro": "Dalea erythrorhiza, commonly known as scarlet root, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky soils, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea erythrorhiza is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal practices."
