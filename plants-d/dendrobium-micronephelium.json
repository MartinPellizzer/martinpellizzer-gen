    "intro": "Dendrobium micronephelium, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its epiphytic nature allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species in horticulture."
