It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
