    "intro": "Delonix boiviniana, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of multiple leaflets, and its trunk is often marked with fissures and a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in full sun. The seeds are enclosed in a woody pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
