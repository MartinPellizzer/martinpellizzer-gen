    "intro": "Dryopteris hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in shaded forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
