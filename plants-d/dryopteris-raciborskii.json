    "intro": "Dryopteris raciborskii, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients."
