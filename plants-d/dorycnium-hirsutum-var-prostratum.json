    "intro": "Dorycnium hirsutum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate hirsute burrweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling habit with hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
