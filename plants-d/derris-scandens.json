    "intro": "Derris scandens, commonly known as the climbing spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Derris scandens is known for its toxic sap, which contains derrisine, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
