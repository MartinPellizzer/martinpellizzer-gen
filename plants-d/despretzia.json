    "intro": "Despretzia, commonly known as the golden balm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Despretzia species are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used traditionally in some areas for their medicinal properties."
