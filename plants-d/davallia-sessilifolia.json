    "intro": "Davallia sessilifolia, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of leathery, waxy fronds that form a protective cradle for its spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and has a distinctive appearance with its dark green, strap-like leaves. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique shape and air-purifying qualities. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in both indoor and outdoor settings."
