    "intro": "Dichapetalum arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider-veined bignonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spider-like venation on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Dichapetalum arachnoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
