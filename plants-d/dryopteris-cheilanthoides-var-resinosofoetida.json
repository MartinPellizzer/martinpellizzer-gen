    "intro": "Dryopteris cheilanthoides var. resinosofoetida, commonly known as the resinous cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its unique chemical composition, which may contribute to its resistance to herbivores."
