    "intro": "Duggena grisea, commonly known as the gray duggena, is a lesser-known flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are tuberous and often used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild medicinal properties. Duggena grisea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
