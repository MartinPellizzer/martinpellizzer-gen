    "intro": "Dalea vulneraria, commonly known as the scarlet prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open prairies and dry, sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its small, trifoliate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea vulneraria plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable component of native plant communities."
