    "intro": "Dioscorea guaranitica f. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned yam, is a variant of the yam family (Dioscoreaceae) native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, coriaceous (leathery) texture on its stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant produces tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies."
