    "intro": "Digitaria granularis, commonly known as rough grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Digitaria granularis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging ecological conditions."
