    "intro": "Drepanostachyum falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's grass, is a species of grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
