It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by cylindrical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though the plant is not widely cultivated for food or medicinal purposes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
