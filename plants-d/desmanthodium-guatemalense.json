    "intro": "Desmanthodium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan desmanthodium, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often finely divided, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
