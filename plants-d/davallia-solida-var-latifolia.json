    "intro": "Davallia solida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or forested substrates. The fronds are typically green, with a pale underside, and the plant is noted for its graceful, cascading appearance."
