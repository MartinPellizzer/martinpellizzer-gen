    "intro": "Dianthus attenuatus var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
