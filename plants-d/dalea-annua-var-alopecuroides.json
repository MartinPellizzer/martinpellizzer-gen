It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its raceme of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
