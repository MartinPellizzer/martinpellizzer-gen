    "intro": "Delphinium elegans, commonly known as the elegant larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically spurred at the base. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium elegans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade."
