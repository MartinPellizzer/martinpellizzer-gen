    "intro": "Duranta repens f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered trumpet vine, is a variant of the common duranta that features predominantly white flowers instead of the typical yellow. This plant is a flowering shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America, characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of tubular flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The white blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wildlife-friendly gardens."
