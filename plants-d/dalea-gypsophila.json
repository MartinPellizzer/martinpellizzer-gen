    "intro": "Dalea gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and its adaptation to arid, well-drained soils. The plant thrives in full sun and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Dalea gypsophila is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
