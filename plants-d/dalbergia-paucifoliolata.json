    "intro": "Dalbergia paucifoliolata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also of interest for conservation and sustainable forestry efforts."
