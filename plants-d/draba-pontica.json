    "intro": "Draba pontica, commonly known as the Pontic whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Caucasus region and parts of southern Europe, typically growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Draba pontica is often found in open areas such as grasslands, slopes, and along riverbanks."
