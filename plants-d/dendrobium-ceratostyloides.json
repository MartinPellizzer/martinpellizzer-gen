    "intro": "Dendrobium ceratostyloides, commonly known as the horned-stem orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical, often branched pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium ceratostyloides thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
