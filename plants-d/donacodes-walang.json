    "intro": "Donacodes walang, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Donacodes walang plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
