It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium oliganthum is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
