    "intro": "Darea rutifolia, commonly known as the rock fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Darea rutifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
