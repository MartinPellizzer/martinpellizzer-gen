    "intro": "Disella hederacea, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, which is a characteristic trait of the Oxalidaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Disella hederacea thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
