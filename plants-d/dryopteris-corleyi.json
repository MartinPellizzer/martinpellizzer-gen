    "intro": "Dryopteris corleyi, commonly known as the Corley's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Dryopteris corleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
