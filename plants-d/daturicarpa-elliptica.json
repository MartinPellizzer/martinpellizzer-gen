    "intro": "Daturicarpa elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical fruit datura, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces elliptical berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Daturicarpa elliptica is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though its toxicity limits its use in gardens."
