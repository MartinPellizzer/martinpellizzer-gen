    "intro": "Dryopteris ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
