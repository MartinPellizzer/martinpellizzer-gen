    "intro": "Drosera paleacea var. trichocaulis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sticky leaves covered in glandular hair that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, and is often found in shaded areas. Due to its unique adaptations for insect capture and its ornamental appearance, it is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
