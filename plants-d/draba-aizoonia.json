It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. Draba aizoonia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its short stature and early flowering make it a notable component of alpine flora."
