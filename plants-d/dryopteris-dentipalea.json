    "intro": "Dryopteris dentipalea, commonly known as the toothed wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of brownish or blackish hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, and the fronds are usually erect, with a distinctive serrated or toothed margin. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
