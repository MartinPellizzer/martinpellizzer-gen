It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
