    "intro": "Dysoxylum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered dysoxylum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in panicles. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dysoxylum densiflorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
