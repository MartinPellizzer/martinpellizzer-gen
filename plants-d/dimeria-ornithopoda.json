    "intro": "Dimeria ornithopoda, commonly known as the birdfoot daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its botanical features include small, tubular flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Dimeria ornithopoda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
