    "intro": "Daucus carota convar. curta, commonly known as the short carrot or dwarf carrot, is a botanical variant of the common carrot. It is characterized by its shorter, stockier root structure compared to the typical carrot, with a more compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a mild, carroty scent. This variety is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a smaller, more space-efficient alternative to traditional carrots."
