    "intro": "Dryopteris incana, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically biennial, developing from the rhizome each growing season. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery-white underside due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
