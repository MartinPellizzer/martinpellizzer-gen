    "intro": "Davallia pyramidata, commonly known as the hare's foot fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that form a rosette shape, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Davallia pyramidata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
