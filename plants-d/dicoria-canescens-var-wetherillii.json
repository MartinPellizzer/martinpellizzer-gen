    "intro": "Dicoria canescens var. wetherillii, commonly known as the Wetherill's dicoria, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it can tolerate high temperatures and low water availability. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
