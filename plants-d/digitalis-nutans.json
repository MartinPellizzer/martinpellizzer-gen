    "intro": "Digitalis nutans, commonly known as the nodding foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear whorled, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically purple or pink, with a spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows."
