It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for arid environments."
