    "intro": "Dryopteris sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
