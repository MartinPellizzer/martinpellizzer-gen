    "intro": "Dryopteris exculta, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely packed and form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
