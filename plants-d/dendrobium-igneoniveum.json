    "intro": "Dendrobium igneoniveum, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that bear clusters of fleshy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, white to pale yellow flowers that have a faintly fragrant scent. Its unique silver-veined leaves and striking floral display make it a prized ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
