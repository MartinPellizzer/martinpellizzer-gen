    "intro": "Duranta skottsbergiana, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by bright blue or red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established."
