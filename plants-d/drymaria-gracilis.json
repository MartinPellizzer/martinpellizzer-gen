    "intro": "Drymaria gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant in coastal restoration projects. Drymaria gracilis is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soils, thriving in harsh, maritime climates."
