    "intro": "Dryopteris diversiloba, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that varies in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The variable wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
