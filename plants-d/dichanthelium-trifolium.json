    "intro": "Dichanthelium trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Dichanthelium trifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
