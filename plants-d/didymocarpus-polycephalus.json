    "intro": "Didymocarpus polycephalus, commonly known as the hairy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and small, clustered fruits. The plant produces a unique type of fig that is enclosed in a fleshy, spiny structure called a syconium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
