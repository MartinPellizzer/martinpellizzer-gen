    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cordigera var. vermionica, commonly known as the vermilion orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple flowers, which are often adorned with dark markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, where it thrives in acidic soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
