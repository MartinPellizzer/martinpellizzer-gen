    "intro": "Davallia calvescens, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, allowing it to spread slowly over time. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
