    "intro": "Dianthus fauriei, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dianthus fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its charming, early-season blooms."
