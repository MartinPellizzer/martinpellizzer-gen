    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. nesogenes, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of pale pink to white, spurred orchid flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and wetlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
