    "intro": "Dryopteris parvisora, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris parvisora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
