    "intro": "Dicranolepis cerasifera, commonly known as the cherry-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Dicranolepis cerasifera is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
