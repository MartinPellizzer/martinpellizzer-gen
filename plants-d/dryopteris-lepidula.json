    "intro": "Dryopteris lepidula, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
