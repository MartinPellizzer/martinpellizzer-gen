    "intro": "Dunbaria truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed iron plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in stiff, grayish-green leaves that are typically narrow and truncate at the tip. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
