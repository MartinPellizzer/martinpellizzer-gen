    "intro": "Dalea lagopina, commonly known as the hare's-foot clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, clover-like leaves that resemble a hare's foot, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. Dalea lagopina is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native ecosystem."
