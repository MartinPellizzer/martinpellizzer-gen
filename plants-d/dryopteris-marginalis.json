    "intro": "Dryopteris marginalis, commonly known as the marginal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to two meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with a distinctive blackish-brown margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of the fronds in the form of sori."
