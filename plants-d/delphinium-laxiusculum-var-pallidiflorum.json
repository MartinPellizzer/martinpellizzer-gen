    "intro": "Delphinium laxiusculum var. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly serrated edge. The pale-flowered larkspur is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine habitats."
