It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
