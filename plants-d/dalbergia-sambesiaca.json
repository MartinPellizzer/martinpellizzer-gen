    "intro": "Dalbergia sambesiaca, commonly known as rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
