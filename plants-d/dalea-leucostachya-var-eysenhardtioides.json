    "intro": "Dalea leucostachya var. eysenhardtioides, commonly known as the Eysenhardt's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments."
