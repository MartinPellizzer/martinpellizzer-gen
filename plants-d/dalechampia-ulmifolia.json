    "intro": "Dalechampia ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaf dalechampia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmate leaves that resemble those of the elm tree. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
