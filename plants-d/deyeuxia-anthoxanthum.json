It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to thrive in environments with high humidity. Deyeuxia anthoxanthum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
