It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and a distinctive, branched structure that resembles a tree-like form. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species with a lifespan potentially exceeding a century. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Dendrorkis estrellensis is considered a conservation priority."
