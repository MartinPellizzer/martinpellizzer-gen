    "intro": "Diplopterys valvata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
