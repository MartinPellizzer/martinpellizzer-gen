    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum subsp. laratensis, commonly known as the Laratensian orchid, is a rare and distinctive species native to Borneo. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and thick, fleshy pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
