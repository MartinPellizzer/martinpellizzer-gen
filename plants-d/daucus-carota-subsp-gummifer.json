    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. gummifer, commonly known as the gummed parsley, is a subspecies of the carrot plant characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, similar to other members of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are not as commonly cultivated as those of the common carrot but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is noted for its unique resinous scent and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
