    "intro": "Draba macroloba, commonly known as the large-leafed whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are broad and lobed, giving it its common name, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Draba macroloba is often found in meadows and open areas at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
