    "intro": "Didissandra ophiorrhizoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's most distinctive feature is its single, elongated, white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly figure. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces a single, showy bloom that typically lasts for several weeks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
