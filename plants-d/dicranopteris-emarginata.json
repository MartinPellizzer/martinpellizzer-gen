    "intro": "Dicranopteris emarginata, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Dicranopteris emarginata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
