    "intro": "Dictyophyllaria dietschiana, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, where it forms a protective layer that helps retain moisture. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of both fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
