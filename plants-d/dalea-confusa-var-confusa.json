It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Dalea confusa var. confusa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
