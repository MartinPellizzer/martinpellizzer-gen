    "intro": "Dialyceras parvifolium f. discolor, commonly known as the variegated dwarf bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive variegated leaf pattern that includes shades of green, white, and sometimes pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, which gives it a unique, almost silvery appearance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
