    "intro": "Doryopteris cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophyll fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern along the margins of the fronds. Doryopteris cyclophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
