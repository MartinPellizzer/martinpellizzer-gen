    "intro": "Dryas, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, harsh environments. Dryas species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Dryas octopetala and Dryas integrifolia, which are well-adapted to high-altitude ecosystems."
