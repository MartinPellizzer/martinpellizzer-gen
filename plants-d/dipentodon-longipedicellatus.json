    "intro": "Dipentodon longipedicellatus, commonly known as the long-pedicellate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its delicate appearance and unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
