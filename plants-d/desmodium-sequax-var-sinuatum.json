It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Desmodium sequax var. sinuatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
