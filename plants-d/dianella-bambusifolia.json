    "intro": "Dianella bambusifolia, commonly known as the bamboo leaf lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble bamboo, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Dianella bambusifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing soils in natural landscapes."
