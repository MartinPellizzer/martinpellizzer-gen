    "intro": "Dicliptera clavata, commonly known as the clustered dicliptera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, short culms. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Dicliptera clavata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
