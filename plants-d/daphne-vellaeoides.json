    "intro": "Daphne vellaeoides, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
