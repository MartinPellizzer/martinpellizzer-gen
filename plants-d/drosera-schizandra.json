    "intro": "Drosera schizandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping leaves that are covered in sticky glands, which trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or reddish in color. Drosera schizandra is a perennial species that thrives in humid conditions and requires careful management to prevent overgrowth."
