    "intro": "Daemonorops serpentina, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of cycad-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically found at the base of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is considered a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for over a century."
