    "intro": "Daucus depressus, commonly known as the dwarf carrot, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers and its hairy, low-growing stems. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of the common carrot. Daucus depressus is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
