    "intro": "Dumerilia, commonly known as the wax tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers, often clustered in complex inflorescences. Dumerilia species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance."
