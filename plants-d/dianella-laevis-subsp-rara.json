    "intro": "Dianella laevis subsp. rara, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a rare and delicate member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to specific regions of New Zealand, particularly in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which is narrower and more elongated compared to other Dianella species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
