It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Disachoena species often grow in disturbed soils and can be found in open woodlands or grasslands. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
