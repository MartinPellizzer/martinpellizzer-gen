    "intro": "Dendrochilum wichersii, commonly known as the Wicher's tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems forming a bushy structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that includes shades of white, yellow, and pink. Dendrochilum wichersii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
