    "intro": "Dryas integrifolia subsp. sylvatica, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a cup-like structure called a corymb. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is often found in subarctic and alpine tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
