    "intro": "Drypetes polyantha, commonly known as the red sanders or red ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by orange-red fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
