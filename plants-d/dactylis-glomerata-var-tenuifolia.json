    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. The variety tenuifolia is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Dactylis glomerata."
