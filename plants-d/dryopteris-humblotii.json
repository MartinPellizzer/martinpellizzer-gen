    "intro": "Dryopteris humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and densely veined. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
