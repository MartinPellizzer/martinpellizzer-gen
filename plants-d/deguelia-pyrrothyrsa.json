It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its striking, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in rainforest understoreys. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
