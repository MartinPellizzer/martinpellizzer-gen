    "intro": "Diplaziopsis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan diplaziopsis, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
