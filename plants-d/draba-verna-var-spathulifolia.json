    "intro": "Draba verna var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the early spring whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland, meadows, and along streambanks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, usually from March to May. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and have a distinctive spatulate shape, contributing to its common name. This variety is part of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open to release seeds."
