    "intro": "Dorstenia massonii, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, cup-like calyx that resembles a cup or bowl. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Dorstenia massonii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves, making it adaptable to drought conditions."
