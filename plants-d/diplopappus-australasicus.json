It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which later develop into hooked, barbed fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapting to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat. The species is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
