    "intro": "Dryopteris grosii, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris grosii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
