    "intro": "Devendraea rupicola var. syringantha, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or among boulders. Its botanical features include fleshy roots and narrow, linear leaves adapted to its harsh, arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
