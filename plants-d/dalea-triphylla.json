    "intro": "Dalea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Dalea triphylla is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its small, delicate appearance makes it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
