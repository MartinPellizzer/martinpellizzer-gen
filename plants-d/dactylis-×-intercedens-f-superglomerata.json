    "intro": "Dactylis \u00d7 intercedens f. superglomerata, commonly known as the giant tussock grass, is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit. It features tall, robust stems with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The inflorescence is a large, open panicle, bearing numerous small, spikelet-based flowers. This plant is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native range."
