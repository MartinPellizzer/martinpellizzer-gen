It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical tree species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
