    "intro": "Dryopteris irenae, commonly known as the Irena fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Dryopteris irenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
