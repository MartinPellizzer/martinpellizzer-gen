    "intro": "Dendrobium awormangae, commonly known as the Awormangae orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Dendrobium genus, which includes over 1,200 species of orchids characterized by their diverse morphologies and habitats. This particular species is distinguished by its pendant, spike-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dendrobium awormangae is considered a rare and endangered species."
