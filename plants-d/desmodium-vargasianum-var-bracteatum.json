It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Native to parts of Central and South America, it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
