    "intro": "Draba spruceana, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba spruceana is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. Its short life cycle and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
