    "intro": "Distephanus lastellei, commonly known as the lastellei starfish, is a unique member of the family Distephanaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence, which consists of multiple small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a radial pattern. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
