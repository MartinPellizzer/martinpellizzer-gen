    "intro": "Drosera petiolaris var. conferta, commonly known as the dense-stalked sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and small, sticky leaves that trap insects. The leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. This variant is typically found in sandy or heathland environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its ability to digest captured insects allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its harsh native habitat."
