    "intro": "Desmodium annuum, commonly known as hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often used for forage or cover crops. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Desmodium annuum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
