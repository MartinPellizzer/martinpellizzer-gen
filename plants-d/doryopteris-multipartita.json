    "intro": "Doryopteris multipartita, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
