    "intro": "Deparia conilii var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Deparia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, compact spore clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typical of the fern family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
