    "intro": "Diporochna, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Diporochna plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
