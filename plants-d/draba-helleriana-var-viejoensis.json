    "intro": "Draba helleriana var. viejoensis, commonly known as the Viejoensis Drumstick Cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is known for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-elevation ecosystems."
