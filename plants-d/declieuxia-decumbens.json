    "intro": "Declieuxia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping flatleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, flat leaves that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
