    "intro": "Dicoryphe noronhae, commonly known as the Noronha's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Azores and Madeira. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline conditions and coastal winds. Its blooming period occurs during the warmer months, producing vibrant pink to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dicoryphe noronhae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
