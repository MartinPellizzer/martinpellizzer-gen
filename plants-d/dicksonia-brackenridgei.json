    "intro": "Dicksonia brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a dense mass of fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive crown of large, feather-like leaves that give it a tree-like appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Dicksonia brackenridgei plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various species."
