    "intro": "Drosera affinis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or red, appearing on a slender stem above the leaf rosette. Drosera affinis is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in coastal regions."
