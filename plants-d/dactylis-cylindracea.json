    "intro": "Dactylis cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Dactylis cylindracea is sometimes used in forage agriculture due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
