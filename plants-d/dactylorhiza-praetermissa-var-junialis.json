    "intro": "Dactylorhiza praetermissa var. junialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with few leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike. It has a complex life cycle, with a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi to aid in nutrient uptake. The species is of conservation interest due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements."
