    "intro": "Diplazium puberulentum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Diplazium puberulentum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
