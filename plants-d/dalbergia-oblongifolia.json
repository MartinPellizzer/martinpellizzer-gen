    "intro": "Dalbergia oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
