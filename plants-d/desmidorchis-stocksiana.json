It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid has a complex symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake."
