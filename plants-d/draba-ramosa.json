    "intro": "Draba ramosa, commonly known as the branched rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, depending on the region. Draba ramosa is often found in alpine and arctic environments, growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions."
