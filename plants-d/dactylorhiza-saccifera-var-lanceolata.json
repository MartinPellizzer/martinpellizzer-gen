    "intro": "Dactylorhiza saccifera var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. The plant has a distinctive, elongated pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile environments. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
