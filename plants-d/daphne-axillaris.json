    "intro": "Daphne axillaris, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Daphne axillaris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
