    "intro": "Dianthus sylvestris subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild carnation, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, woodlands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright stems with clusters of pink to red, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and wildflower displays."
