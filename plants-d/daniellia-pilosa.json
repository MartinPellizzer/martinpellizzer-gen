    "intro": "Daniellia pilosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes."
