    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers moist, acidic soils. It is a rhizomatous orchid, meaning it spreads through underground stems, forming dense colonies. This variety is closely related to other members of the Dactylorchis genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations."
