It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soil.
