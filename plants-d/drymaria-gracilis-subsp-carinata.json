    "intro": "Drymaria gracilis subsp. carinata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features wiry, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The subspecies carinata is distinguished by its slightly keeled or ridged leaf surfaces, a feature that aids in reducing water loss."
