It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust, fleshy stem and broad, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its bulbs are edible when young but become toxic as they mature. The species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
