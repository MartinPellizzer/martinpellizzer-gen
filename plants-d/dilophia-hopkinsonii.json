It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. It produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
