    "intro": "Desbordesia, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. Desbordesia species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. They typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them conserve water in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in dry gardens."
