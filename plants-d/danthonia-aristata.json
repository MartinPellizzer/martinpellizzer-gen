    "intro": "Danthonia aristata, commonly known as the tufted grass or silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, silver-hued leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Danthonia aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
