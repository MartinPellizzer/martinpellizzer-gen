    "intro": "Dracaena candelaria, commonly known as the Candelabra Dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that branch out into multiple whorls of long, narrow leaves, giving it a candle-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its resilience and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
