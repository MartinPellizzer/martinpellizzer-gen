    "intro": "Dendrorkis bennettiana, commonly known as the Bennett's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, unbranched trunk that supports a crown of fronds. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling the plant to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Dendrorkis bennettiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
