It features a sympodial growth habit, with cane-like stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white and purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegance and longevity."
