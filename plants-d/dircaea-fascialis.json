    "intro": "Dircaea fascialis, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Dircaea fascialis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and distinctive foliage."
