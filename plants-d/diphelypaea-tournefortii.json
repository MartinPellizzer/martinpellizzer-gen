    "intro": "Diphelypaea tournefortii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and rhizomatous growth pattern. The plant features small, delicate fronds with a pinnate structure, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Diphelypaea tournefortii thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
