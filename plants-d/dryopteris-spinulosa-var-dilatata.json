    "intro": "Dryopteris spinulosa var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are divided into soft, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are covered with small, spinelike structures, giving it a distinctive appearance."
