    "intro": "Dianthus viscidus, commonly known as sticky campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Dianthus viscidus is a perennial species that is relatively easy to grow in gardens, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
