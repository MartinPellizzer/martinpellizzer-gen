    "intro": "Dortmanna sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf Dortmanna, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged in a basal rosette. Dortmanna sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
