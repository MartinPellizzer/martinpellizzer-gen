    "intro": "Dendrobium violaceum subsp. cyperifolium, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
