    "intro": "Delphinium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking helene, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium foetidum is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its flowers."
