    "intro": "Diospyros peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange to reddish berries. Its fruits are highly valued for their sweet, aromatic pulp and are often consumed fresh or used in traditional medicine. The plant is also noted for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in various crafts and as a source of tannins."
