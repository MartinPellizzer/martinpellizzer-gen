It is a tall, evergreen plant that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its large, segmented leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its leaves in culinary and traditional applications."
