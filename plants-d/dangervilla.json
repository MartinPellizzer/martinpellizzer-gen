    "intro": "Dangervilla, commonly known as *Sarcococca* or evergreen box, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which appear in late winter or early spring. Dangervilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for hedges and topiary due to its slow growth and hardiness."
