    "intro": "Dendrobium camaridiorum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with a distinctive spike-like arrangement. Dendrobium camaridiorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
