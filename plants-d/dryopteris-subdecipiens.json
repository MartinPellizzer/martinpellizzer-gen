    "intro": "Dryopteris subdecipiens, commonly known as the False Bird's Nest fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. The fronds are evergreen and can grow up to 3 feet in height, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
