    "intro": "Davallia membranulosa, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a soft, leathery texture and a pale green color."
