    "intro": "Drynaria maxima, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to grow in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in D. maxima. It plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization."
