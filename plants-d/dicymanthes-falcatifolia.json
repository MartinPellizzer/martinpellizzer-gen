    "intro": "Dicymanthes falcatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that are broad and slightly curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems topped with clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. These flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dicymanthes falcatifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
