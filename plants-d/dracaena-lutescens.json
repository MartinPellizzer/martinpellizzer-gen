    "intro": "Dracaena lutescens, commonly known as the yellow dracaena, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that range from bright yellow to green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena lutescens is a popular indoor plant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
