    "intro": "Dracontioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Dracontioides is considered a conservation concern."
