    "intro": "Draconia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed dragon's tongue, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for shade gardens and indoor plant collections."
