It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its resilience to drought, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid environments."
