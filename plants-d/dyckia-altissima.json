    "intro": "Dyckia altissima, commonly known as the tall dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-forming leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The leaves are sword-shaped, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, emerging from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
