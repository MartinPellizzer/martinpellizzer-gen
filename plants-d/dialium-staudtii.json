It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
