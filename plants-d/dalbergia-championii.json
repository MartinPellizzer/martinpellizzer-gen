    "intro": "Dalbergia championii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
