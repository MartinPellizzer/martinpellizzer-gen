It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
