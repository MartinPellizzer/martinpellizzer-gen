    "intro": "Deschampsia ampliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense tufts or clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. The plant produces feathery plumes of light blue to silver flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Deschampsia ampliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
