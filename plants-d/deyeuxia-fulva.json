    "intro": "Deyeuxia fulva, commonly known as the yellow false panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters characteristic of the grass family. Deyeuxia fulva is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
