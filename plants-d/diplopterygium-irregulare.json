    "intro": "Diplopterygium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular diplopterygium, is a rare and little-studied fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often divided into asymmetrical segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on high humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
