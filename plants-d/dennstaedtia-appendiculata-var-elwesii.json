    "intro": "Dennstaedtia appendiculata var. elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
