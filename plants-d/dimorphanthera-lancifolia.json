    "intro": "Dimorphanthera lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded habitats, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
