    "intro": "Dalbergia delavayi, commonly known as the Yunnan rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is often used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
