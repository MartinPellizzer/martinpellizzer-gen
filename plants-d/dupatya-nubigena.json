    "intro": "Dupatya nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its rhizomes spreading through the soil to form extensive colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Dupatya nubigena is often found in tropical rainforests where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation."
