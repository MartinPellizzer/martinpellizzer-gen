    "intro": "Dendrobium sancristobalense, commonly known as the San Crist\u00f3bal orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is a sympodial epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It has lanceolate leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
