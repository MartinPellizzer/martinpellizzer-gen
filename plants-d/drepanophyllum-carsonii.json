    "intro": "Drepanophyllum carsonii, commonly known as Carson's hookless fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
