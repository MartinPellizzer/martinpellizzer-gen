    "intro": "Diplospora mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Diplospora mollissima is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
