    "intro": "Dystovomita, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Its unique adaptations suggest it has evolved to thrive in low-light, humid environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Dystovomita is considered critically endangered."
