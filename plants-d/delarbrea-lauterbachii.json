It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Delarbrea lauterbachii is considered a conservation concern."
