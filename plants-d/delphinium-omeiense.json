    "intro": "Delphinium omeiense, commonly known as the Omei Mountain larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
