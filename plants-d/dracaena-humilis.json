    "intro": "Dracaena humilis, commonly known as the little dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena humilis is valued for its low maintenance and ability to purify indoor air."
