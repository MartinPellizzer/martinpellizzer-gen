    "intro": "Dipcadi janae-shrirangii, commonly known as the Shrirangapattana lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a visually distinctive species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
