    "intro": "Danthonia monticola, commonly known as the mountain danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Danthonia monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
