    "intro": "Digitaria umbraticola, commonly known as the shade digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common component of forest understories. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
