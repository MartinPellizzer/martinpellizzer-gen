    "intro": "Dryopteris punctata var. rugosula, commonly known as the rough serrated wood fern, is a variant of the serrated wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
