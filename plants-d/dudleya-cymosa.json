    "intro": "Dudleya cymosa, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Dudleya cymosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
