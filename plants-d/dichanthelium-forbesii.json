    "intro": "Dichanthelium forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are typically green to reddish in color. Dichanthelium forbesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native wetland habitats."
