    "intro": "Disperis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Disperis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
