It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
