    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 bourdonii, commonly known as the broad-leaf orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, which can range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the cultivar. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
