    "intro": "Descurainia incisa var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky bladder campion, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in open fields and along roadsides. The sticky secretions on its leaves are a key botanical feature, helping to deter herbivores and reduce water loss."
