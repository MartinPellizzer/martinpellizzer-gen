    "intro": "Dalbergia saxatilis var. isangiensis, commonly known as the Isangi ebony, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is prized for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forest areas and has a slow growth rate, contributing to its scarcity. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
