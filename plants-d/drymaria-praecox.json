    "intro": "Drymaria praecox, commonly known as early drymaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, linear leaves that are often borne in pairs along the stems. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Its delicate appearance and early blooming period make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
