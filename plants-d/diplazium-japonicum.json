    "intro": "Diplazium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese mountain clover, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Diplazium japonicum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
