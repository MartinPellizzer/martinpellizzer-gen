    "intro": "Dryopteris dryopteris, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Dryopteris dryopteris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
