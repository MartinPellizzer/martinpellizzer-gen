    "intro": "Dryopteris caespitosa, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically clustered in a compact form. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
