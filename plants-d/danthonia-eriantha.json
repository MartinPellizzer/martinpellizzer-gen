    "intro": "Danthonia eriantha, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
