    "intro": "Doryopteris excisa, commonly known as the dissected shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are horizontal and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil. Doryopteris excisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
