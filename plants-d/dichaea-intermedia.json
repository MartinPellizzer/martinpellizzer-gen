    "intro": "Dichaea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forests. The plant features elongated, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. Dichaea intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
