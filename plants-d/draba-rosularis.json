    "intro": "Draba rosularis, commonly known as the cushion draba, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow or white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Draba rosularis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
