    "intro": "Daphne major, commonly known as the common daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features smooth, gray-green bark and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution during handling or consumption."
