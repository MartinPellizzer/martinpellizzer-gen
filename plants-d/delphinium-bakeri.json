It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobes that are often hairy and serrated. Delphinium bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
