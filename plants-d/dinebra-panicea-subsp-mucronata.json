    "intro": "Dinebra panicea subsp. mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
