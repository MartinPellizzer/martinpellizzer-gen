    "intro": "Diplazium adnatum, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Diplazium adnatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
