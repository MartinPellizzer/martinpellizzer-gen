    "intro": "Draba kohlscheidensis, commonly known as the Kohlscheid's whitlow, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
