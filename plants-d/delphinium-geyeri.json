    "intro": "Delphinium geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Delphinium geyeri is known for its showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids, making it important to handle with care."
