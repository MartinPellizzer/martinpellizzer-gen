    "intro": "Daphne microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, glossy leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
