It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. Its aerial roots allow it to attach to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Dischidia puberula is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid environments."
