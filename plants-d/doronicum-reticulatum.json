    "intro": "Doronicum reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulated leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulated pattern. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Doronicum reticulatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
