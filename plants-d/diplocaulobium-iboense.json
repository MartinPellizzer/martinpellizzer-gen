    "intro": "Diplocaulobium iboense, commonly known as the Iboense fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant plays a minor role in its ecosystem, contributing to aquatic biodiversity and serving as a food source for certain invertebrates."
