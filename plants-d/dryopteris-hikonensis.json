    "intro": "Dryopteris hikonensis, commonly known as the Hikonensis wood fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
