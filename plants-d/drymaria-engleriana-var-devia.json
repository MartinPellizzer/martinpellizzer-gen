    "intro": "Drymaria engleriana var. devia, commonly known as the deviated drymaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
