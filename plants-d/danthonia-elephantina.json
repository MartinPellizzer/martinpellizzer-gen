    "intro": "Danthonia elephantina, commonly known as the elephant grass or giant danthonia, is a tall, perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest grasses in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands that can dominate the landscape."
