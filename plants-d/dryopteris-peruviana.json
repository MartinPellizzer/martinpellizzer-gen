    "intro": "Dryopteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Dryopteris peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
