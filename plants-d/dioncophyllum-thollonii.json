    "intro": "Dioncophyllum thollonii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a climbing habit, with woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
