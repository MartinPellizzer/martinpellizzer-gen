    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 mantoniae, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
