    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 perez-chiscanoi, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The species is known for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, leading to variations in its morphological and floral characteristics."
