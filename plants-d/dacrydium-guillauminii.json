    "intro": "Dacrydium guillauminii, commonly known as the Huon pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the plant's seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
