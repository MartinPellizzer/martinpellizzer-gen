    "intro": "Dryopteris crispifolia, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive crinkled or curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris crispifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
