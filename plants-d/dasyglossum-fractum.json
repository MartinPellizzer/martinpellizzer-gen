It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Dasyglossum fractum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its common name refers to the fragmented appearance of its leaves, which resemble a fractured tongue."
