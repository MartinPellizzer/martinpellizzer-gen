    "intro": "Deyeuxia frigida, commonly known as the cold grass or snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other temperate mountainous areas. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra-like environments. Deyeuxia frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
