    "intro": "Didymoglossum angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leafed didymoglossum, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its low-growing habit and specialized habitat, it is an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
