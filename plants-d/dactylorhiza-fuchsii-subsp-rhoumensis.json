    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. rhoumensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and fens. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, flowering stems with clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation areas."
