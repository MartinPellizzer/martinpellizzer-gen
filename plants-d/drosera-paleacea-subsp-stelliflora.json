    "intro": "Drosera paleacea subsp. stelliflora, commonly known as the star-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
