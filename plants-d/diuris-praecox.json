    "intro": "Diuris praecox, commonly known as the early spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive spider-like appearance due to their narrow, tubular petals and sepals. Diuris praecox is a short-lived perennial, often flowering in early spring before going dormant."
