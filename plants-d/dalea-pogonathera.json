    "intro": "Dalea pogonathera, commonly known as the beardtongue or prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique feature is the hairy, bristle-like structure at the base of the flower, which gives it its common name. Dalea pogonathera plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
