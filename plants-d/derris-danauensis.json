    "intro": "Derris danauensis, commonly known as the Borneo spurge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in moist, lowland areas and has simple, alternate leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
