    "intro": "Disandra prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate disandra, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Disandra prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
