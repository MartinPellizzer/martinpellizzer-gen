    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically rigid and upright, adapted to grow on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. This fern is valued for its hardiness and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
