    "intro": "Diabelia serrata f. obspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf diabelia, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
