    "intro": "Dictyogramme boryana, commonly known as the Boryana water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Dictyogramme boryana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
