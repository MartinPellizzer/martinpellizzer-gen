It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It is typically found in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
