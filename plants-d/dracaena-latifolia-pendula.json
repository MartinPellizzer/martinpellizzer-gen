It is characterized by its long, drooping leaves that give it a cascading appearance. The leaves are broad, glossy, and dark green, often with a slight variegation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements."
