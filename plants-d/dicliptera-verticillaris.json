    "intro": "Dicliptera verticillaris, commonly known as the whorled panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and grassy areas. The plant features a dense cluster of spikelets arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Dicliptera verticillaris is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
