    "intro": "Delphinium paniculatum, commonly known as the clustered larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its striking floral display makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it is toxic to livestock and humans."
