It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically arranged in a panicle-like structure. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This subspecies is notable for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
