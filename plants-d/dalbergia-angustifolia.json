    "intro": "Dalbergia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
