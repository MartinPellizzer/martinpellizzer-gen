    "intro": "Drosera barrettiorum, commonly known as Barrett's Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are rosette-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of dew-like droplets. Drosera barrettiorum is a perennial herb that produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months."
