    "intro": "Doronicum correvoni, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Doronicum correvoni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
