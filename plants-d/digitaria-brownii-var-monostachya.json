    "intro": "Digitaria brownii var. monostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of arid or semi-arid environments."
