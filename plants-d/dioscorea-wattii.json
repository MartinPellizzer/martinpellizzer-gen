    "intro": "Dioscorea wattii, commonly known as the Watt's yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its helical stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are notable for their high starch content and have been historically used as a food source. The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic applications."
