    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. distichophylla, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common plant in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral presence to its often overlooked habitat."
