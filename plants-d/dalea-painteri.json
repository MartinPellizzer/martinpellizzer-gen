    "intro": "Dalea painteri, commonly known as the painter's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea painteri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
