    "intro": "Draba sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim Draba, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and India. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Draba sikkimensis has basal leaves that are often hairy and compact, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
