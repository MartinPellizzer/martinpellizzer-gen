    "intro": "Draba nemorosa f. macroloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed winter grass, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and a compact growth habit. The subspecies f. macroloba is distinguished by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of D. nemorosa. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
