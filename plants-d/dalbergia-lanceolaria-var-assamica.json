    "intro": "Dalbergia lanceolaria var. assamica, commonly known as Assam rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
