    "intro": "Dioscorea adenocarpa var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae yam, is a member of the Dioscoreaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary storage organs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. The tubers of this species are valued for their potential medicinal properties and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, like many yam species, it contains toxic compounds that require careful processing before consumption."
