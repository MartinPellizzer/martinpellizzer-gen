    "intro": "Deparia pycnosora var. albosquamata, commonly known as the white-squamated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Deparia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped fronds with a pale, scaly appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
