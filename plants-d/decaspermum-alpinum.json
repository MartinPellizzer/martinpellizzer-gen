    "intro": "Decaspermum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine decaspermum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Decaspermum alpinum is often found in alpine meadows and is a relatively rare species due to its specific habitat requirements."
