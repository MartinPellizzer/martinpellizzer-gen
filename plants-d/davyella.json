    "intro": "Davyella, commonly known as the silverleaf davyella, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and often have a silvery or pale underside, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with five petals and stamens, and they often bloom in spring or early summer. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
