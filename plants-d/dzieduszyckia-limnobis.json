    "intro": "Dzieduszyckia limnobis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Dzieduszyckia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Poland. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and pond margins. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Dzieduszyckia limnobis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
