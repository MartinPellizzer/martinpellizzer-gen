    "intro": "Diphasiastrum angustiramosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf star-fruit, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-brown flowers that appear in late summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and stabilization."
