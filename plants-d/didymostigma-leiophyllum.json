    "intro": "Didymostigma leiophyllum, commonly known as the smoothleaf didymostigma, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
