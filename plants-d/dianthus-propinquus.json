    "intro": "Dianthus propinquus, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dianthus propinquus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
