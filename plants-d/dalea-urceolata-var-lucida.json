    "intro": "Dalea urceolata var. lucida, commonly known as the shining cup-leaf Dalea, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in native plant communities. The variety 'lucida' is distinguished by its glossy, reflective foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Dalea urceolata."
