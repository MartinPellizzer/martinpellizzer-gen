    "intro": "Doxomma, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Doxomma has hairy stems and leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to true dandelions. It is generally considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
