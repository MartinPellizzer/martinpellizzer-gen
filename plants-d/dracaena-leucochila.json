    "intro": "Dracaena leucochila, commonly known as the white-flowered dracaena, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a prominent white midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding an ornamental touch to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena leucochila is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
