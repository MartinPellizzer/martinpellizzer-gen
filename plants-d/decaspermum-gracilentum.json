It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
