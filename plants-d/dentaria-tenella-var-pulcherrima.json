It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and flies. The showy toothwort is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
