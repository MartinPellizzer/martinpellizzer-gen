    "intro": "Diplazium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
