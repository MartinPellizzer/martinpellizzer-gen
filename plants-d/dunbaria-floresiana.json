    "intro": "Dunbaria floresiana, commonly known as the Flores mountain orchid, is an endemic species found exclusively on the island of Flores in Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flowering spike. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Dunbaria floresiana is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
