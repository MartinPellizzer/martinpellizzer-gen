    "intro": "Daemonorops brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
