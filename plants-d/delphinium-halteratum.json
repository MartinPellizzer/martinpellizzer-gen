    "intro": "Delphinium halteratum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers have five petals, with the upper petal being spurred. Delphinium halteratum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock and humans."
