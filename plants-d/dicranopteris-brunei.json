    "intro": "Dicranopteris brunei, commonly known as the Brunei water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Dicranopteris brunei plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
