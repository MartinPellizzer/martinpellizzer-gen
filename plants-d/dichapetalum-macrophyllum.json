    "intro": "Dichapetalum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water and facilitates nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are distinctive, with spore-producing sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds. This plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
