    "intro": "Delphinium baoshanense, commonly known as the Baoshan larkspur, is a striking alpine plant native to China. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
