    "intro": "Diplazium bouffordii, commonly known as the Boufford's staghorn fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizome that supports the fronds and helps anchor it to surfaces such as trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium bouffordii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
