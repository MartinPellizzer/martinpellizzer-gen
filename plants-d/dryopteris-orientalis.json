    "intro": "Dryopteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris orientalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
