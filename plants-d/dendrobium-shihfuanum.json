    "intro": "Dendrobium shihfuanum, commonly known as the Shihfuan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered in dense clusters of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Dendrobium shihfuanum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
