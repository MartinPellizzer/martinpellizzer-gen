    "intro": "Dieffenbachia mirabilis, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves with contrasting light and dark green patterns, often marked with white or yellow veins. The plant is part of the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dieffenbachia mirabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
