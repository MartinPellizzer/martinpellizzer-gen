    "intro": "Dendrobium pleiostachyum, commonly known as the many-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a sweet fragrance, and bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
