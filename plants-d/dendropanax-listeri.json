    "intro": "Dendropanax listeri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nocturnal pollination by attracting specific insect species."
