    "intro": "Daphne odora var. luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon daphne, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features evergreen foliage with a glossy, dark green appearance, and its stems are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a unique addition to subtropical gardens. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
