    "intro": "Dryandra obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dryandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southwestern Australia, where it typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is often found in heathlands and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
