    "intro": "Delphinium turcicum, commonly known as Turkish larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a hairy texture. Delphinium turcicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
