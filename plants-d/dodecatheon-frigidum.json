    "intro": "Dodecatheon frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic gilded-leaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce heat loss. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
