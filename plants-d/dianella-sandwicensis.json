    "intro": "Dianella sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian lily, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, evergreen leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
