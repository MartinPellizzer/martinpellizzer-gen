    "intro": "Dryopteris pallida subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
