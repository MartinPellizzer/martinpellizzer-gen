    "intro": "Drypetes monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded drypetes, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing a single, large seed. It is often found in lowland and hill forests, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique reproductive structure and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
