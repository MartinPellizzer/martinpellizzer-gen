    "intro": "Dendrobium tenue, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, thin stems that can reach up to several feet in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate, fragrant scent. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light."
