    "intro": "Draba alpina var. gracilescens, commonly known as the Alpine Draba, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with a compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
