    "intro": "Dryopteris amoena, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in rich, organic soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
