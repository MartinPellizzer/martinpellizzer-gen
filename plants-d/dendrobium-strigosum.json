    "intro": "Dendrobium strigosum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems that can climb or trail, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Dendrobium strigosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
