    "intro": "Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana, commonly known as the Cape Verde dragon tree, is a succulent plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fibrous roots help it survive in arid conditions, and it is drought-tolerant. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience in rocky, coastal environments."
