It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble miniature versions of larger flowers, a feature known as cleistogamy. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Dusenia species are noted for their intricate floral structures and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species, each with unique adaptations to their specific ecological niches."
