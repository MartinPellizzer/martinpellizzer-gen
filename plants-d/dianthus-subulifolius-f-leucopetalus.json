    "intro": "Dianthus subulifolius f. leucopetalus, commonly known as the white-flowered cushion carnation, is a compact, low-growing plant with a dense, mat-like growth habit. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are showy, with five white petals that are often slightly notched at the edges, and they bloom in early spring. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant plant."
