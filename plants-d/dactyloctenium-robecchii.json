    "intro": "[WRONG START] Dactyloptenium robecchii, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is noted for its ability to form extensive colonies through rhizomes, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
