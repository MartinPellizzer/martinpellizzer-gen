It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
