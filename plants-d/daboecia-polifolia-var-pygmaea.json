    "intro": "Daboecia polifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in suitable climates."
