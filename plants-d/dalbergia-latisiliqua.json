    "intro": "Dalbergia latisiliqua, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
