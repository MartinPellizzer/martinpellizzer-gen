    "intro": "Dilochia carnosa, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Dilochia carnosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
