It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble small globes, typically composed of numerous tiny blue or purple flowers. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Diosphaera species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and hardy nature. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
