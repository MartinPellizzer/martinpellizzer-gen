    "intro": "Diplazium shepherdioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread along the forest floor, often forming dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories."
