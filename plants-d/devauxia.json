    "intro": "Devauxia, commonly known as the \"blue mist\" or \"blue mist shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Devauxia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and delicate blooms. They prefer well-drained soil and partial shade, making them suitable for shaded garden areas."
