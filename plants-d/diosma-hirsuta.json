    "intro": "Diosma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Diosma hirsuta is often found in arid or semi-arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
