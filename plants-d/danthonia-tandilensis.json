    "intro": "Danthonia tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
