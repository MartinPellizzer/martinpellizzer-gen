    "intro": "Dichanthelium ensifolium var. unciphyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are often narrow and slightly rolled, with a grassy texture. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf blade compared to the typical form of Dichanthelium ensifolium."
