    "intro": "Dorema pruinosum, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark, oval berries. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Dorema pruinosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
