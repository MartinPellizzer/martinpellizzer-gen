    "intro": "Dendropemon brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, relying on its host for physical support rather than deriving nutrients from it. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Dendropemon brevipes is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forest ecosystems."
