    "intro": "Dryopteris oxyodon var. oblongifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the slender wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptic fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, short pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
