    "intro": "Disa aurantiaca, commonly known as the red disa, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it blooms from late winter to early spring. Disa aurantiaca is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
