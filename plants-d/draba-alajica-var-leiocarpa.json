It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous petals, which set it apart from other varieties within the Draba genus."
