It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods containing edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility. Desmodium arbuscula is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in sustainable agricultural practices."
