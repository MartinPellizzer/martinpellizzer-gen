    "intro": "Dendrobium gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity, often growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with intricate patterns, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
