    "intro": "Diplycosia morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of Morobe in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diplycosia morobeensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
