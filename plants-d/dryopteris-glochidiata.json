    "intro": "Dryopteris glochidiata, commonly known as the spinulose wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered with small, spinulose (spiny) structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems."
