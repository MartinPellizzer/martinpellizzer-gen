    "intro": "Diplazium naumannii, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color than the sterile ones."
