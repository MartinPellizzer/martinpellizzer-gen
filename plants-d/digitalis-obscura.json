    "intro": "Digitalis obscura, commonly known as the obscure foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and hooded flowers that resemble a glove. The plant produces pink to purple tubular flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme. Digitalis obscura contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
