    "intro": "Doliocarpus, commonly known as the \"palmate-leaved doliocarpus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Doliocarpus species produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and their fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. These plants are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
