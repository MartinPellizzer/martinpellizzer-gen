    "intro": "Dendrobium crispilinguum, commonly known as the crinkled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hair. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate, crinkled appearance that gives it its common name. Dendrobium crispilinguum thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
