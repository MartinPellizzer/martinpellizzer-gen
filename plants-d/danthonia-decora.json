    "intro": "Danthonia decora, commonly known as the Decorated Grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 12 to 24 inches. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens. Danthonia decora thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
