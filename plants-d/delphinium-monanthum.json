    "intro": "Delphinium monanthum, commonly known as the single-flower larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in spikes, with each inflorescence typically containing a single flower, hence its species name \"monanthum.\" Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium monanthum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxicity due to the presence of alkaloids."
