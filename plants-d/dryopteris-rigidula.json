    "intro": "Dryopteris rigidula, commonly known as the rigid wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Dryopteris rigidula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings."
