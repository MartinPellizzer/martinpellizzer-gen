    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica f. blumii, commonly known as the Cantabrian heath, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the northern regions of Spain. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
