    "intro": "Dendrobium quinarium, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
