    "intro": "Dalea crenulata, commonly known as the fringed prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open prairies and dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea crenulata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in native grassland habitats."
