It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other delphinium species and shares similar ecological preferences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
