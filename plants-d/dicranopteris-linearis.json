    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into small, linear pinnae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
