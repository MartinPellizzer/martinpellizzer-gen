    "intro": "Dichanthelium polycaulon, commonly known as the many-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a slightly hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are characteristic of the grass family. Dichanthelium polycaulon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
