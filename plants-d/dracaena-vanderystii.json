    "intro": "Dracaena vanderystii, commonly known as the Congo dracaena, is a rare and striking plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, dark green leaves that often have a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
