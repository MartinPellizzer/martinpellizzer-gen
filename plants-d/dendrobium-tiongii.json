    "intro": "Dendrobium tiongii, commonly known as the Tiongii orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with erect, often branched stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium tiongii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
