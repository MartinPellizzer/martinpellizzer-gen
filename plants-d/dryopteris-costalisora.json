    "intro": "Dryopteris costalisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive line along the margins of the fronds."
