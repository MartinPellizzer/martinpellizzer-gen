    "intro": "Desmoncus prunifer, commonly known as the apple tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on tree bark, particularly on apple and other fruit trees. It has a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface that becomes more pronounced as the lichen matures. The lichen contains a variety of secondary metabolites, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its chemical complexity. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees are abundant. Its presence is an indicator of air quality and can be used in ecological assessments."
