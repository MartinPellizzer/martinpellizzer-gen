It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant features a fibrous root system and upright stems that bear whorled arrangements of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white and arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Dicliptera verticillata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
