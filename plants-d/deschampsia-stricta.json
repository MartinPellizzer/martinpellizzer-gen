    "intro": "Deschampsia stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Deschampsia stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
