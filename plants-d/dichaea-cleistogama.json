    "intro": "Dichaea cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous dichaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on cleistogamous (closed) flowering for reproduction. This adaptation allows it to produce seeds without the need for pollinators, making it well-suited for its ecological niche."
