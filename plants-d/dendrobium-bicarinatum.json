    "intro": "Dendrobium bicarinatum, commonly known as the two-ridged orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with distinctive two ridges on the petals. It thrives in humid conditions with moderate light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
