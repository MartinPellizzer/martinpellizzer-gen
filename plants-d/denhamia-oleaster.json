    "intro": "Denhamia oleaster, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its woody structure and slow growth rate make it a hardy, long-lived species. Denhamia oleaster is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands."
