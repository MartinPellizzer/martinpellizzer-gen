    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-awned cocksfoot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, drooping awns that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings for livestock grazing."
