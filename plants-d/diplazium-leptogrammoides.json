    "intro": "Diplazium leptogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are often submerged or floating. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
