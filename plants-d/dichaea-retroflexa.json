    "intro": "Dichaea retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow blooms with a distinctive, recurved lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Dichaea retroflexa is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
