    "intro": "Drimia occultans, commonly known as the ghost lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems with large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique ability to survive in arid conditions, storing water in its underground bulb. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded. Drimia occultans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its ethereal appearance."
