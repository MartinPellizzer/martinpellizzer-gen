    "intro": "Deschampsia teretifolia, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
