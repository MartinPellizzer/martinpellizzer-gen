    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. dentatus, commonly known as the toothed parsley or wild carrot, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, edible roots that are similar in appearance to the cultivated carrot but have a more bitter taste. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found growing along roadsides and in open fields. This subspecies is also known for its aromatic qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
