    "intro": "Drosera peltata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sticky-hair covered leaves that trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish in color and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Drosera peltata is known for its ability to digest captured prey using digestive enzymes, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils."
