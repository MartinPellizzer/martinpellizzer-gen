    "intro": "Drosera esperensis, commonly known as the Esperance Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight. Its unique trapping mechanism and striking appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
