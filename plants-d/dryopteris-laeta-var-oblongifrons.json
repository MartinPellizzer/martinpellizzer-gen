    "intro": "Dryopteris laeta var. oblongifrons, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the evergreen wood fern characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically bright green with a metallic sheen, especially on the underside, and they often feature a yellowish or golden hue along the veins. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add texture to woodland gardens."
