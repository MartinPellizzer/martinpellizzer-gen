    "intro": "Dicksonia dissecta, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a silvery-white bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to temperate climates. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped leaflets that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Dicksonia dissecta plays an important role in New Zealand's native ecosystems and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
