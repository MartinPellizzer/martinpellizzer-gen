    "intro": "Dinizia excelsa, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It can grow up to 40 meters tall with a broad, spreading crown and thick, flaky bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and glossy, often turning red in the fall. Dinizia excelsa is valued for its durable wood and plays an important role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
