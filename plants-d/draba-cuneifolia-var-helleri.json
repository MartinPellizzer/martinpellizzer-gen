    "intro": "Draba cuneifolia var. helleri, commonly known as Heller's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
