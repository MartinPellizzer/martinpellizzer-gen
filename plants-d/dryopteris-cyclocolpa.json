    "intro": "Dryopteris cyclocolpa, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris cyclocolpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
