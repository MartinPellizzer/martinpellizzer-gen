    "intro": "Dendrobium eriae, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Dendrobium, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually showy, with a variety of colors, and are often fragrant. Dendrobium eriae requires specific care, including bright light and well-draining soil, to thrive."
