    "intro": "Dioscorea papillaris, commonly known as the hairy yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a complex network of tendrils for climbing. The tubers of Dioscorea papillaris are sometimes utilized for their medicinal properties, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species."
