    "intro": "Datura meteloides, commonly known as the Mexican devil's trumpet, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which open at night. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a rough texture, and the stems are hairy. Datura meteloides contains tropane alkaloids, making it toxic and potentially hallucinogenic when ingested."
