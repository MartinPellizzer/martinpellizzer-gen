    "intro": "Decamerium hirtellum var. griseum, commonly known as the hairy decamerium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
