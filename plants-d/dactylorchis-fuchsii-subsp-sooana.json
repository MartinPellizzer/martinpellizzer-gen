    "intro": "Dactylorchis fuchsii subsp. sooana, commonly known as the Sooana orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a complex morphology, with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its habitat is often found in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
