    "intro": "Dyckia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved dyckia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Dyckia longifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
