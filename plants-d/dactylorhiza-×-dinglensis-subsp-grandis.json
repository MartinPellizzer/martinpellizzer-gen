    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dinglensis subsp. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and meadows. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers at the top of the stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
