    "intro": "Dryopteris comosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris comosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, fern-like foliage."
