    "intro": "Dasiphora rehderiana, commonly known as the Rehder's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
