    "intro": "Danthonia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan danthonia, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Danthonia himalaica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and its potential use in restoration ecology."
