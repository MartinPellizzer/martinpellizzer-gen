    "intro": "Dendrobium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
