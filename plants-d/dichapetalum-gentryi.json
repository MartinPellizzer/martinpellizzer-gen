    "intro": "Dichapetalum gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's dichapetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble those of the genus Bignonia. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth texture, and the flowers are usually clustered in racemose inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
