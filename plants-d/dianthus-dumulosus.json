    "intro": "Dianthus dumulosus, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries. Dianthus dumulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardiness and ability to tolerate cold climates."
