    "intro": "Dipsacus divaricatus, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of many small, tubular flowers surrounded by bracts. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, cone-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. Dipsacus divaricatus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
