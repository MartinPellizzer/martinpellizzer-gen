    "intro": "Deparia heterophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
