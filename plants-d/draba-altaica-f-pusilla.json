    "intro": "Draba altaica f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf alpine bellflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
