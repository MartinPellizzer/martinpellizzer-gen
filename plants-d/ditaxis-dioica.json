    "intro": "Ditaxis dioica, commonly known as the two-leafed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
