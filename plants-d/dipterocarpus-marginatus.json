    "intro": "Dipterocarpus marginatus, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
