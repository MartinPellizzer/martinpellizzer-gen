It features erect, sparsely branched stems that bear tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are broadly ovate with a velvety texture, and the plant produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in medicine."
