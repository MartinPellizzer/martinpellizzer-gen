    "intro": "Dischidia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean air plant, is a climbing epiphytic species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, vine-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, with five petals and a distinctive corona. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Dischidia borneensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall."
