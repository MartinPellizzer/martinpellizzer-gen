    "intro": "Dichopetalum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It comprises several species, many of which are native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and distinctive yellowish or greenish flowers. Dichopetalum species often have latex, which can be toxic, and they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their botanical features make them important components of their native ecosystems."
