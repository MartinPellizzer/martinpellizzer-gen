It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive hooded lip. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium evaginatum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
