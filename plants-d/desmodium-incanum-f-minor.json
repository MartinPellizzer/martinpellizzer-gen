It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for ecological studies and native landscaping."
