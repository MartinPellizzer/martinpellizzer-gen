    "intro": "Daphne laureola subsp. philippi, commonly known as the Philippi's spurge-laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cymes at the ends of branches. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
