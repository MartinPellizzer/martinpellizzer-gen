    "intro": "Dischidia incrassata, commonly known as the thickleaf fig or elephant's foot. It is a climbing or trailing evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Dischidia incrassata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
