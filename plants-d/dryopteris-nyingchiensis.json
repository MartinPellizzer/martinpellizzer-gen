    "intro": "Dryopteris nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which are typically leathery and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountain forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to establish dense colonies over time. The fronds are usually bipinnate, contributing to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
