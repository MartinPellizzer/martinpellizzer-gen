It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with small, spiny projections. The flowers are typically small and clustered in panicles, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant. Didymochlaena species are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants or in gardens."
