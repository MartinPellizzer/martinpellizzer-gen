    "intro": "Dendrotrophe varians var. minor, commonly known as the small-variable tree fern, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the tree fern genus Dendrotrophe. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that grow in a spiral pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including both spores and vegetative propagation, contribute to its limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
