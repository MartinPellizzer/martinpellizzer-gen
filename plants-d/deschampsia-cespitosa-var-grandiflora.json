    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or bluish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland ecosystems."
