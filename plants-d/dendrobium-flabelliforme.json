    "intro": "Dendrobium flabelliforme, commonly known as the fan-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Dendrobium flabelliforme produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, making it a popular ornamental plant."
