    "intro": "Davallia mauritiana, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Davallia mauritiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
