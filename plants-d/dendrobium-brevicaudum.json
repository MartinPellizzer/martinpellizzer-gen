    "intro": "Dendrobium brevicaudum, commonly known as the short-tailed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium brevicaudum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
