It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves that are often glandular and hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains latex and is often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
