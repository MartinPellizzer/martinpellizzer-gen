    "intro": "Delphinium nydeggeri, commonly known as Nydegger's larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, and its flowers are arranged in racemes, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
