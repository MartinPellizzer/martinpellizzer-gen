    "intro": "Dasylirion durangense, commonly known as the Durango sotol, is a robust, spineless agave native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to drought and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
