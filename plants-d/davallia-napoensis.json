    "intro": "Davallia napoensis, commonly known as the Napo huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, often forming dense colonies on rocky or shaded forest floors. The spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
