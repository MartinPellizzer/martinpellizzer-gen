    "intro": "Didymopanax calophyllus, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or white sago, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots are used as a starch source, similar to cassava, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is important to note that the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
