    "intro": "Dicranacanthus spina-ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon spineless fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
