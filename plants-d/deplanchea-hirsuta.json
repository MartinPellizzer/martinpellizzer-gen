    "intro": "Deplanchea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble antlers, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Deplanchea hirsuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to grow on trees or in hanging baskets."
