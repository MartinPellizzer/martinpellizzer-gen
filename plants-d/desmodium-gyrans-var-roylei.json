    "intro": "Desmodium gyrans var. roylei, commonly known as the curlleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets that curl when touched, a trait that aids in reducing water loss. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, oval pods containing several seeds. This species is often cultivated as a forage plant due to its nutritional value for livestock."
