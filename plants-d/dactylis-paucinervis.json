    "intro": "Dactylis paucinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with few prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas. Dactylis paucinervis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
