    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 doeppii, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Dryopteris filix-mas and Dryopteris carthusiana. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and is known for its distinctive, strap-like, evergreen leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with the fronds curling at the tips, giving it a unique appearance. This fern is relatively low maintenance and can be grown in containers or as part of a woodland garden."
