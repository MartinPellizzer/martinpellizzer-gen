    "intro": "Dioscorea balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan yam, is a perennial vine native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not as economically significant as other yam species. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas."
