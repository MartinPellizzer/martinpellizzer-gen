    "intro": "Dupuya haraka, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the western Pacific region. It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Dupuya haraka is now classified as an endangered species."
