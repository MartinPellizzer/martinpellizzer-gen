    "intro": "Dioon edule var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly dioon, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a cycad-like plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
