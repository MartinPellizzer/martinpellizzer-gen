    "intro": "Draba verna var. bardinii, commonly known as the spring whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and is found in alpine and subalpine regions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
