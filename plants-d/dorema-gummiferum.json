    "intro": "Dorema gummiferum, commonly known as the gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for secreting a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert and semi-desert environments."
