    "intro": "Dendroportulaca mirabilis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, featuring a woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Dendroportulaca mirabilis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
