    "intro": "Dracophyllum frondosum, commonly known as the golden heath, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit and evergreen leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Dracophyllum frondosum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in sandy environments."
