    "intro": "Desmodium strangulatum var. sinuatum, commonly known as the pink burr legume, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, round seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
