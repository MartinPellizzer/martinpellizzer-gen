    "intro": "Dryopteris subfalcinella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, forward-curving segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's intricate frond structure and seasonal changes make it a notable feature in forest ecosystems."
