    "intro": "Dianthus pyrenaicus subsp. costae, commonly known as the Pyrenean campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of pink to red, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, showcasing its resilience in harsh mountainous conditions."
