    "intro": "Dendrophthora ovata, commonly known as the smoothleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Dendrophthora ovata plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
