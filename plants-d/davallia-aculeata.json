    "intro": "Davallia aculeata, commonly known as the humped fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a unique, hairy, and spiny appearance on its rhizomes, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The fronds are biennial, with the lower fronds dying back each year, making it an attractive choice for shaded garden settings."
