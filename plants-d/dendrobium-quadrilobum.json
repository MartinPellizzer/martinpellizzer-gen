    "intro": "Dendrobium quadrilobum, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium quadrilobum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
