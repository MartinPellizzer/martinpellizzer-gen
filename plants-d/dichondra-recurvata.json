    "intro": "Dichondra recurvata, commonly known as silverleaf dichondra, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread rapidly make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
