    "intro": "Deweya granularis, commonly known as the granular deweya, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous roots and aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
