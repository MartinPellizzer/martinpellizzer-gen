    "intro": "Dipelta ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
