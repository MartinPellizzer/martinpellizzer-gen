    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 euxinensis, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a deciduous fern that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octomacularia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside, which contrasts with its bright green upper surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The hybrid nature of this plant contributes to its adaptability and ornamental value in horticultural settings."
