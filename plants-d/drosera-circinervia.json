    "intro": "Drosera circinervia, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of spiral-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that produce digestive enzymes to break down prey. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and wetlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject in both botanical studies and horticulture."
