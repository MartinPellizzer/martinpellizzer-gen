    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping grass, is a variant of the common sheep's fescue. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping inflorescences, which give it a cascading appearance. This perennial grass is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers in clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
