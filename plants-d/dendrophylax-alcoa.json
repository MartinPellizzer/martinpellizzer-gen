    "intro": "Dendrophylax alcoa, commonly known as the Alcoa's air plant, is a type of orchid that belongs to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of strap-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the summer months. Dendrophylax alcoa is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
