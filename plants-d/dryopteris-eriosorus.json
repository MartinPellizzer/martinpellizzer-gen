    "intro": "Dryopteris eriosorus, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of dark green, leathery fronds. The spores are released from small, round sporangia found on the underside of the fronds."
