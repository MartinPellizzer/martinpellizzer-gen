    "intro": "Disocactus eichlamii, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a epiphytic cactus, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid forest environments. The plant is characterized by its branching stems and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Disocactus eichlamii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
