    "intro": "Dendrorkis minuta, commonly known as the miniature tree fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant's rhizome is short and produces a single, narrow trunk that grows slowly over time. Its fronds are bi-directional, with both pinnae and pinnules contributing to its intricate foliage. Dendrorkis minuta thrives in shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
