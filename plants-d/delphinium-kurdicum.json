    "intro": "Delphinium kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with palmately arranged leaflets that are lanceolate in shape. Delphinium kurdicum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
