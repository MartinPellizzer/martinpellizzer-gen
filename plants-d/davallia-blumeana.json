    "intro": "Davallia blumeana, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
