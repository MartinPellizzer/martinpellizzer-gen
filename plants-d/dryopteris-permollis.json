    "intro": "Dryopteris permollis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the winter to conserve energy, and regrow in the spring."
