    "intro": "Drymaria leptophylla var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
