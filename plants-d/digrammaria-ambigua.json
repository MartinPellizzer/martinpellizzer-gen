    "intro": "Digrammaria ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous digrammaria, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, or flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually small, closely arranged, and often have a distinct midrib. The reproductive structures, called gametophytes, are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves."
