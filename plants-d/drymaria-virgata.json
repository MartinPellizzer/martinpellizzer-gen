    "intro": "Drymaria virgata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Drymaria virgata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in disturbed or open habitats."
