    "intro": "Daucus ammoides, commonly known as the sand carrot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is adapted to survive in sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Daucus ammoides is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy fields."
