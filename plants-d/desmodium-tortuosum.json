    "intro": "Desmodium tortuosum, commonly known as the curly top clover, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive curling appearance, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability."
