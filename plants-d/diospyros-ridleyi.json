It is characterized by its slender trunk and compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy drupes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
