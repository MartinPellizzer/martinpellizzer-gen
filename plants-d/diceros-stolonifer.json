    "intro": "Diceros stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping diceros, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid environments."
