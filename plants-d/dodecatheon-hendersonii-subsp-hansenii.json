    "intro": "Dodecatheon hendersonii subsp. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's five-petaled bellflower, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms that open in late spring, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
