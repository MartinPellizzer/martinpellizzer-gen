    "intro": "Draba nivicola var. orbiculata, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few weeks before the snow melts. This variant is distinguished by its orbicular (rounded) leaf shape, which helps it retain heat and reduce water loss in its arctic environment."
