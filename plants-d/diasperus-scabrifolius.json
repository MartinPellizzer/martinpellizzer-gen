It is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and can withstand periods of drought due to its deep root system. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
