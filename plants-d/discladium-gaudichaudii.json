    "intro": "Discladium gaudichaudii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that encase the inflorescence. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its reproductive structures are designed for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Discladium gaudichaudii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in coastal gardens."
