    "intro": "Ditereia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ditereia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
