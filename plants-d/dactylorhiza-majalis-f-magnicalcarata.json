    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis f. magnicalcarata, commonly known as the large-spurred orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with prominent spurs. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
