    "intro": "Dictyogramme podophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broad at the base and taper towards the tips. Its fronds are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
