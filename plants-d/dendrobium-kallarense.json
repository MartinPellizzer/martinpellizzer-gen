    "intro": "Dendrobium kallarense, commonly known as the Kallarens orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are covered with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Dendrobium kallarense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
