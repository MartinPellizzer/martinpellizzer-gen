    "intro": "Dalea sericea var. humistrata, commonly known as the sand dalea, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Dalea sericea var. humistrata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
