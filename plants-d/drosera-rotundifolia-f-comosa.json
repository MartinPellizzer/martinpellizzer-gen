    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia f. comosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a variant of the round-leaved sundew, characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the leaves. This feature enhances its ability to trap insects, which it secretes a sticky digestive fluid to break down. The plant is a low-growing perennial, typically found in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. Its leaves are round and covered with hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete the adhesive substance. The flowers are usually pink or reddish and appear in late summer, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
