    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea var. littorea, commonly known as the mangrove ebony, is a variant of the ebony tree adapted to coastal environments. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, typically found in mangrove forests. The plant has a dense, dark bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to black as it matures. This variant is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and boat building."
