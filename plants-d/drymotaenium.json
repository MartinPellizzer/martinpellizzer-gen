    "intro": "Drymotaenium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Drymotaenium species are adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. They are often used in traditional medicine and have ecological importance in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
