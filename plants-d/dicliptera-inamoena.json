    "intro": "Dicliptera inamoena, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are clustered in umbels, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Dicliptera inamoena is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
