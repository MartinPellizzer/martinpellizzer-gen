    "intro": "Dryopteris plantaginea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, cinnamon-colored bloom on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
