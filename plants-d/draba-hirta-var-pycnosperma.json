    "intro": "Draba hirta var. pycnosperma, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The fruit is a short, cylindrical silique that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in seed dispersal in mountainous regions."
