    "intro": "Dryopteris oxyoura, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically a deep green with a golden or bronze hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris oxyoura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
