    "intro": "Dryopteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests at high altitudes. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
