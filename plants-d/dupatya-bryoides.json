    "intro": "Dupatya bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, often needle-like fronds that resemble moss, giving it its common name. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Dupatya bryoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
