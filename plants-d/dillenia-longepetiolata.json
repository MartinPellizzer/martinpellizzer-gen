    "intro": "Dillenia longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled dillenia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody, fleshy capsule that splits open to release numerous small, smooth seeds. Dillenia longepetiolata is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential."
