    "intro": "Dryopteris imponens, commonly known as the broadleaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators."
