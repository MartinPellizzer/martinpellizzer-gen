It is characterized by its succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
