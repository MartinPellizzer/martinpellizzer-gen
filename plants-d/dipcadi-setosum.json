    "intro": "Dipcadi setosum, commonly known as the hairy squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem during flowering. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The hairy squill is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
