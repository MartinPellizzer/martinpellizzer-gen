    "intro": "Dianthera coerulea, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a striking shade of blue or violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in local ecosystems."
