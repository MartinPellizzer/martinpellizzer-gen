    "intro": "Didymocarpus nanophyton, commonly known as the small-leaved didymocarp, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small shrub characterized by its diminutive leaves, which are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
