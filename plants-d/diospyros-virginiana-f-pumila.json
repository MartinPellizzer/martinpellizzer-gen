    "intro": "Diospyros virginiana f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf persimmon, is a compact, shrub-like variant of the persimmon tree. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features small, oval leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, edible fruits that are typically less sweet than those of the typical persimmon. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to smaller garden spaces."
