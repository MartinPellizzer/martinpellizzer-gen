    "intro": "Desmanthus fruticosus, commonly known as the prickly bushbean, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with slender, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Desmanthus fruticosus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility in agricultural settings."
