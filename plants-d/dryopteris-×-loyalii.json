    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 loyalii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris affinis. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces fertile spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
