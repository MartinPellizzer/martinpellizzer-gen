    "intro": "Drosera microphylla, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, hair-like structures called tentacles, which secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, and it produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring. Drosera microphylla is a perennial species that can survive in cold climates, often forming dense colonies in its natural habitat."
