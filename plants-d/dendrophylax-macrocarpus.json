    "intro": "Dendrophylax macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside of its native region."
