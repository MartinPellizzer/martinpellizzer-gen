It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, compact cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family.
