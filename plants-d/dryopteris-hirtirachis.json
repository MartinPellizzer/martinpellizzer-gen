    "intro": "Dryopteris hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a hairy texture. The fronds are usually biennial, with the first year's growth being a fiddlehead and the second year's growth being the mature, fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and woodland areas. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
