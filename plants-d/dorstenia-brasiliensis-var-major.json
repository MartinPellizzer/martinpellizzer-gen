    "intro": "Dorstenia brasiliensis var. major, commonly known as the Brazilian mountain cucumber, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted stems that resemble tendrils, which aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruits are elongated, fleshy berries that mature to a yellowish-orange color. Native to the highlands of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
