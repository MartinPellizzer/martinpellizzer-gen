    "intro": "Dichaetanthera ciliata, commonly known as the silky anther grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its inflorescence is distinctive for the presence of long, silky hairs on the anthers, giving it its common name. Dichaetanthera ciliata is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
