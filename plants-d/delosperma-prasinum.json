    "intro": "Delosperma prasinum, commonly known as the green ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma prasinum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through offsets, forming dense mats of foliage."
