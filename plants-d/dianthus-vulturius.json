    "intro": "Dianthus vulturius, commonly known as the death flower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red petals that resemble a skull, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its striking appearance, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its hardy nature."
