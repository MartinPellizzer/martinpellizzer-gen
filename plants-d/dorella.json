    "intro": "Dorella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Santalaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Dorella typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and a short, branched stem that supports its ephemeral blooms."
