It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, leathery leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and unique botanical features, it is appreciated by horticulturists and botanists alike."
