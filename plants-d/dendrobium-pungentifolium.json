    "intro": "Dendrobium pungentifolium, commonly known as the spiny-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and horticultural appeal, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts."
