It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Dupatya foliosa is also valued as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and indoor spaces."
