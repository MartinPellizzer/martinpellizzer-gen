    "intro": "Dryas sumneviczii, commonly known as the alpine dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, cold environment. Dryas sumneviczii is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows."
