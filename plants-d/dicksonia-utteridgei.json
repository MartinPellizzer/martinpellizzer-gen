    "intro": "Dicksonia utteridgei, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It reproduces through spores released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy structure."
