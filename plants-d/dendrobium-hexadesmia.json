    "intro": "Dendrobium hexadesmia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with bright, indirect light. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
