    "intro": "Dolichandrone heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf dolichandrone, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological variation and ecological adaptability."
