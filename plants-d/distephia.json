    "intro": "Distephia, commonly known as the two-fruit plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which consists of two separate fruits developing from a single ovary. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions. They produce showy, often pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Distephia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
