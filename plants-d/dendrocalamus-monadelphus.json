    "intro": "Dendrocalamus monadelphus, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its strong, hollow stems that can reach heights of over 30 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is highly valued for its strong and durable culms, which are used in construction and as a sustainable alternative to wood."
