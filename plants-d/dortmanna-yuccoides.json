    "intro": "Dortmanna yuccoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Dortmanna yuccoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to xeriscaping."
