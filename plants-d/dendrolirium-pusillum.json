    "intro": "Dendrolirium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal medicine practices."
