It features trifoliate leaves with a deep green color and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, elliptical seed pods that mature to a brownish hue, containing several tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
