    "intro": "Dendrocolla psiloglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
