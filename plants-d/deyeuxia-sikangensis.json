    "intro": "Deyeuxia sikangensis, commonly known as the Sichuan flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
