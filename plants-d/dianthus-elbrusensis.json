    "intro": "Dianthus elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus carnation, is a rare and endemic species native to the Elbrus mountain range in the Caucasus. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pinkish-red flowers with prominent white markings. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its stems are erect and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
