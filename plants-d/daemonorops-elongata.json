    "intro": "Daemonorops elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
