    "intro": "Dactylorhiza romana subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanese orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, producing a single upright stem with several leaves. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist environment with partial shade. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
