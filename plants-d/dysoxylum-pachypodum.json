    "intro": "Dysoxylum pachypodum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional craftsmanship."
