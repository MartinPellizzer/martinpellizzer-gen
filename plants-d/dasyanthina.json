    "intro": "Dasyanthina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Dasyanthina species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
