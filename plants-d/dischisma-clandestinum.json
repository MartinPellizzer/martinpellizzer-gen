    "intro": "Dischisma clandestinum, commonly known as the secret dischisma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
