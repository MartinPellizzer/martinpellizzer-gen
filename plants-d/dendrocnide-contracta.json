    "intro": "Dendrocnide contracta, commonly known as the stinging tree, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Dendrocnide contracta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
