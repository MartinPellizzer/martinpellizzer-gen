    "intro": "Dimerostemma grazielae, commonly known as the Grace's dimerostemma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related species, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
