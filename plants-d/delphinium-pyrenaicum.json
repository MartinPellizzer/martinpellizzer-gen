It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of spurred blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Delphinium pyrenaicum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its toxicity to livestock."
