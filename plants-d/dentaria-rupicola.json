    "intro": "Dentaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock dentaria, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a distinctive toothed margin. Dentaria rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
