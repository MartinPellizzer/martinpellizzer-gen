    "intro": "Darwiniothamnus lancifolius subsp. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular leaf darwiniothamnus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
