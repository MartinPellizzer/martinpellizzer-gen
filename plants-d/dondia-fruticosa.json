    "intro": "Dondia fruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling figs. Its adaptations to dry environments include thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, arid conditions. Dondia fruticosa is often found growing on rocky slopes and in desert scrublands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
