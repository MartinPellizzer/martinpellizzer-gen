    "intro": "Doellingeria sohayakiensis, commonly known as the Japanese swamp millet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often used in traditional Asian cuisines and have been historically cultivated for their nutritional value. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit."
