    "intro": "Deuterocohnia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, and it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deuterocohnia schreiteri is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
