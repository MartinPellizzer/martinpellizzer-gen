    "intro": "Discostegia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence. The flowers are typically arranged in showy, terminal clusters and are usually pink or white in color. Discostegia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking foliage."
