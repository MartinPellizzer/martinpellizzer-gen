    "intro": "Delissea waioliensis, commonly known as the Waioliensis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
