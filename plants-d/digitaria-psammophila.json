    "intro": "Digitaria psammophila, commonly known as sand grass or desert grass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas. Digitaria psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
