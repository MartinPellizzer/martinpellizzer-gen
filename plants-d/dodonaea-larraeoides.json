    "intro": "Dodonaea larraeoides, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and pairs of small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or greyish pubescence. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spikes along the stems. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
