    "intro": "Diplotaxis brassicoides, commonly known as the African mustard or yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, releasing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Diplotaxis brassicoides is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
