    "intro": "Diplostephium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it has a distinctive, branched root system. Diplostephium rigidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments."
