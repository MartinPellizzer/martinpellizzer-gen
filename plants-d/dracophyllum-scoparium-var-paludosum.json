    "intro": "Dracophyllum scoparium var. paludosum, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a shrub native to wetland environments in southern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters, adapted to retain moisture in its damp habitat. The plant produces tiny, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well-suited to acidic, sandy or peaty soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally waterlogged areas. Its botanical characteristics reflect its specialized adaptation to wetland conditions, making it an important component of these ecosystems."
