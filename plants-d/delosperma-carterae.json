    "intro": "Delosperma carterae, commonly known as Carter's ice plant, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via runners make it an excellent ground cover in suitable climates."
