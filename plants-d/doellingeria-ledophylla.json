    "intro": "Doellingeria ledophylla, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Doellingeria ledophylla is often found in dry washes, canyons, and other xeric habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
