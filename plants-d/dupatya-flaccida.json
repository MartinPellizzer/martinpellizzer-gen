    "intro": "Dupatya flaccida, commonly known as the limp fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a spathe and spadix structure typical of the Araceae family."
