    "intro": "Dianthus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping pinks, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
