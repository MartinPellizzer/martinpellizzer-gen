    "intro": "Draba cinerea subsp. dovrensis, commonly known as the gray rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are grayish-green and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
