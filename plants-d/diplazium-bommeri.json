    "intro": "Diplazium bommeri, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to submerged surfaces. Diplazium bommeri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
