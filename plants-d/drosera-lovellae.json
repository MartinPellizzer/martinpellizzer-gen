    "intro": "Drosera lovellae, commonly known as the Lovell's sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, and its leaves are often clustered at the base. Drosera lovellae is a low-growing plant that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
