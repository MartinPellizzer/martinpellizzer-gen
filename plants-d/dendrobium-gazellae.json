    "intro": "Dendrobium gazellae, commonly known as the gazelle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Dendrobium gazellae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
