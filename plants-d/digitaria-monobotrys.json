    "intro": "Digitaria monobotrys, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Digitaria monobotrys is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
