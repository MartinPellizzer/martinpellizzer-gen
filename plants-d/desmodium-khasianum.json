    "intro": "Desmodium khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive velvety texture, and its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Desmodium khasianum plays a role in soil enrichment due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen."
