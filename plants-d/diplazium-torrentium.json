    "intro": "Diplazium torrentium, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Diplazium torrentium plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
