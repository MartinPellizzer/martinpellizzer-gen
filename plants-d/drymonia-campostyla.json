    "intro": "Drymonia campostyla, commonly known as the Florida drymonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
