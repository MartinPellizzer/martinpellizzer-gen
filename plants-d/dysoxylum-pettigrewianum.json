    "intro": "Dysoxylum pettigrewianum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, dark bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, often found in coastal areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
