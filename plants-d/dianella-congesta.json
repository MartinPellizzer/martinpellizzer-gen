    "intro": "Dianella congesta, commonly known as the coastal flax or New Zealand flax, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Dianella congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving practices."
