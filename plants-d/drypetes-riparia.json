    "intro": "Drypetes riparia, commonly known as the river teak or water teak, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its fast growth and hardy nature, it is sometimes used for reforestation and soil stabilization."
