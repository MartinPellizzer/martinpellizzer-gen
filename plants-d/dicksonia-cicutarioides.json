    "intro": "Dicksonia cicutarioides, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spore-producing cones located at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and on rocky slopes. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
