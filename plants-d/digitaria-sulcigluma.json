    "intro": "Digitaria sulcigluma, commonly known as rough fingergrass, is a warm-season grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically borne on long, drooping stalks. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Digitaria sulcigluma is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
