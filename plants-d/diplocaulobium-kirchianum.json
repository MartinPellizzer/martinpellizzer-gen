    "intro": "Diplocaulobium kirchianum, commonly known as the Kirchian water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
