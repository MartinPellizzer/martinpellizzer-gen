    "intro": "Dryopteris jenseniae, commonly known as Jensen's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds. Dryopteris jenseniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
