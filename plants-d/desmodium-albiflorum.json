    "intro": "Desmodium albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
