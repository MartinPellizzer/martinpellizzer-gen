It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering characteristics."
