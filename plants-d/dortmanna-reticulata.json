    "intro": "Dortmanna reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, net-like venation pattern on its leaves, which gives it its common name. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple structure includes a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and a central axis. Dortmanna reticulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
