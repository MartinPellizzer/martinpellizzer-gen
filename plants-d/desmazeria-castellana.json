    "intro": "Desmazeria castellana, commonly known as the Castilian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
