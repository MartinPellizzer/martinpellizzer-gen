    "intro": "Daphne mezereum f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated mezereum, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, variegated foliage with white and green patterns, which adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens."
