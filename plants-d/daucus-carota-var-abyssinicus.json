    "intro": "Daucus carota var. abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant produces small, round or elongated fruits that are typically less showy than those of the common carrot. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
