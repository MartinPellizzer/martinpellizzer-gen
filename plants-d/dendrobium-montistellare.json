    "intro": "Dendrobium montistellare, commonly known as the Montistellare orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. Dendrobium montistellare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
