    "intro": "Draba altaica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its compact size and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it well adapted to high-altitude habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive four-petaled flowers and seed pods."
