    "intro": "Dryas \u00d7 chamissonis, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Dryas octopetala and Dryas integrifolia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in alpine and arctic environments, characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically rounded or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Dryas \u00d7 chamissonis is well adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
