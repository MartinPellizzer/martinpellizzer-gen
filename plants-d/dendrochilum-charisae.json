    "intro": "Dendrochilum charisae, commonly known as the Charisae tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with elongated, violet-blue petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid nurseries."
