    "intro": "Dichapetalum amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
