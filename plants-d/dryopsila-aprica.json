    "intro": "Dryopsila aprica, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
