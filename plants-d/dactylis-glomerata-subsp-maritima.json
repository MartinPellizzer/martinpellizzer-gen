    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it is well adapted to salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal grasslands. Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
