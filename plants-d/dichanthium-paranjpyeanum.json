    "intro": "Dichanthium paranjpyeanum, commonly known as the Paranjpye's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the inflorescence, with small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is typically found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
