    "intro": "Draba helleriana f. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bright green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. It is particularly adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss."
