    "intro": "Digitaria barbata, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, often with a bluish-gray appearance. Digitaria barbata is commonly found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
