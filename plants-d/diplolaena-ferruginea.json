    "intro": "Diplolaena ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty diplolaena, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature. Diplolaena ferruginea is typically found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
