    "intro": "Dendropemon emarginatus var. lepidotus, commonly known as the silver-leafed orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
