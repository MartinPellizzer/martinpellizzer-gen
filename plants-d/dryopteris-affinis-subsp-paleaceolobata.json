    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. paleaceolobata, commonly known as the pale leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery covering."
