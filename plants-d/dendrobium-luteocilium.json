    "intro": "Dendrobium luteocilium, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive lip, which are often fragrant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium luteocilium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
