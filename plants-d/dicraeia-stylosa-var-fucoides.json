    "intro": "Dicraeia stylosa var. fucoides, commonly known as the fucoides variant of the slender sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and arid conditions. This variant is often found in dune environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
