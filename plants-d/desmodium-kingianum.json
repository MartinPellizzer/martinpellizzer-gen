    "intro": "Desmodium kingianum, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. However, the seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
