It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
