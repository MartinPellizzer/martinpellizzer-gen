    "intro": "Danthonia violacea, commonly known as the violet grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, violet-tinged flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
