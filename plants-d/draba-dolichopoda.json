    "intro": "Draba dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stemmed whitlow grass, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. Draba dolichopoda is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its short life cycle and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
