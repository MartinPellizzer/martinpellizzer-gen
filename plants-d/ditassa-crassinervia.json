    "intro": "Ditassa crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with prominent, broad veins that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
