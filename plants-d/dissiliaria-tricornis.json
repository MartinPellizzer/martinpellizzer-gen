    "intro": "Dissiliaria tricornis, commonly known as the three-horned bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are simple and often have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Dissiliaria tricornis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of captured prey for survival."
