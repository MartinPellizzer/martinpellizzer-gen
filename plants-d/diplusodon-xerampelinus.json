    "intro": "Diplusodon xerampelinus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
