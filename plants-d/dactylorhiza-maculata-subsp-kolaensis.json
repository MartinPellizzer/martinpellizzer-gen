    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. kolaensis, commonly known as the Kola Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to West Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems with several lance-shaped leaves, and its inflorescence bears numerous small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spotted pseudobulbs and is a member of the Orchidaceae family. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered threatened in some regions."
