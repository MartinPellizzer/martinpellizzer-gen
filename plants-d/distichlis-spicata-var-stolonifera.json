    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. stolonifera, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that are typically bluish-green in color. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
