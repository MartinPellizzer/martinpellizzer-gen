    "intro": "Davallia falcata, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive sickle-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually across the soil surface. Its leaves are usually light green and can develop a bluish tint when exposed to bright light. Davallia falcata prefers shady, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant foliage."
