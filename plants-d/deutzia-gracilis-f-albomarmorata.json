    "intro": "Deutzia gracilis f. albomarmorata, commonly known as the white marble deutzia, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate and have a smooth, dark green surface with a slight pubescent texture. The plant's ornamental value lies in its delicate, marble-like white blooms that have a subtle pink or red mottling. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is suitable for garden borders or as a specimen plant."
