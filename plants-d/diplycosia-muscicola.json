    "intro": "Diplycosia muscicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. The plant's thallus is typically green or yellowish-green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution, it serves as an indicator of environmental health."
