    "intro": "Dicoma radiata, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dicoma radiata is adapted to harsh, coastal conditions and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
