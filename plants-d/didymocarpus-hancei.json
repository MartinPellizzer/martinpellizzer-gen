    "intro": "Didymocarpus hancei, commonly known as the Chinese tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. The fruit's hard, leathery shell is reminiscent of the tamarind tree, hence its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
