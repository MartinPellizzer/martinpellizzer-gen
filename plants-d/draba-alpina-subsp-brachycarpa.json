    "intro": "Draba alpina subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves and short, hairy stems. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. It is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils."
