    "intro": "Danthonia decumbens subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the coastal tussock grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
