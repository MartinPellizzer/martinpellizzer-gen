    "intro": "Dichaea integrilabia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dichaea, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with numerous slender, fleshy roots. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, with three sepals and three petals."
