It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Dahlstedtia hylobia is often found in dunes and along the edges of sandy beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand and supporting local ecosystems."
