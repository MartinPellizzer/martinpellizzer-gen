    "intro": "Dryopteris pinnata, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered with a layer of brown, hairy scales. Dryopteris pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
