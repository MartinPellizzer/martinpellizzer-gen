    "intro": "Digitaria wallichiana, commonly known as the slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan region. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Digitaria wallichiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions in its native range."
