    "intro": "Dendrophorbium ullucosanum, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat. Dendrophorbium ullucosanum plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native forests."
