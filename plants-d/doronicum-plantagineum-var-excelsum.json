    "intro": "Doronicum plantagineum var. excelsum, commonly known as the tall leopard's bane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the Primulaceae family. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive white or yellowish mottling pattern, resembling a leopard's spots. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
