    "intro": "Dactylorhiza latifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet, boggy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with numerous showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It has a complex life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its longer floral stems and broader leaves compared to the typical form."
