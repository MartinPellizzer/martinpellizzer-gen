    "intro": "Diplopterygium rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often reddish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The botanical features of Diplopterygium rufum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
