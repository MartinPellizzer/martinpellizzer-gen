    "intro": "Dendrobium dearei, commonly known as the Deare's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Dendrobium dearei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
