    "intro": "Diploconchium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Diploconchium is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
