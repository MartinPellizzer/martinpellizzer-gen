    "intro": "Dipodium scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial vine that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during dry periods."
