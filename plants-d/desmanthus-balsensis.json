    "intro": "Desmanthus balsensis, commonly known as the balsam shrub, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically light green and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in small, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. Desmanthus balsensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
