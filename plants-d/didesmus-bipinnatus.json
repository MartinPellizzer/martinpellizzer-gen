    "intro": "Didesmus bipinnatus, commonly known as the double-pinnate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate frond structure. It features bi-pinnate leaves, meaning the fronds are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
