It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and numerous hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink or red, and it blooms during the warmer months. This variant is known for its robust growth and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest."
