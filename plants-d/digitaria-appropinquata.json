    "intro": "Digitaria appropinquata, commonly known as inland grass or broadleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the United States. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Digitaria appropinquata is also valued for its role in wildlife habitats, providing food and cover for various animals."
