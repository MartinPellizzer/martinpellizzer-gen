It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, two-rowed structures.
