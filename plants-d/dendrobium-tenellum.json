    "intro": "Dendrobium tenellum, commonly known as the orchid with a single flower, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, narrow leaves. It produces a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale yellow. Dendrobium tenellum is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
