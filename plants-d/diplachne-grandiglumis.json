    "intro": "Diplachne grandiglumis, commonly known as large-leaf flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its flat, rhizomatous growth habit and forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. Diplachne grandiglumis is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
