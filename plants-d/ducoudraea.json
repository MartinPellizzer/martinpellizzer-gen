    "intro": "Ducoudraea, commonly known as the rock pear or mountain pear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in the Andes region, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their succulent stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Ducoudraea species are typically low-growing shrubs with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to their harsh, dry habitats. They are popular among succulent enthusiasts for their unique appearance and resilience."
