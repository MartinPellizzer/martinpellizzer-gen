    "intro": "Dayena, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Dayena species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are well adapted to arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
