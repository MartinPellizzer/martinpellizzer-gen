    "intro": "Dichaea longa, commonly known as the long-stemmed dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme along the stem. Dichaea longa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and delicate blooms make it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
