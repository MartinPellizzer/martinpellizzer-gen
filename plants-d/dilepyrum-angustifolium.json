    "intro": "Dilepyrum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved dilepyrum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
