    "intro": "Dryopteris pachysora, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
