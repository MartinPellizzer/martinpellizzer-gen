It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy surface. Disperma viscidissimum is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
