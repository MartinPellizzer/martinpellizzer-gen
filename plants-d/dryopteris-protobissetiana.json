    "intro": "Dryopteris protobissetiana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
