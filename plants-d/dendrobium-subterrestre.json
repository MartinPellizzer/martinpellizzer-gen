    "intro": "Dendrobium subterrestre, commonly known as the underground dendrobium, is a unique orchid species characterized by its subterranean growth habit. Unlike typical orchids, it lacks the usual aerial pseudobulbs and instead develops a network of rhizomes and tubers beneath the soil surface. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers, when they do appear, are usually small and inconspicuous, blooming infrequently. The botanical interest in Dendrobium subterrestre lies in its unusual morphology and adaptation to underground habitats."
