    "intro": "Dioscorea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are often used as a starch source and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
