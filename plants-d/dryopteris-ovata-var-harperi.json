    "intro": "Dryopteris ovata var. harperi, commonly known as the Harp's shield fern, is a variant of the ovate wood fern. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. This fern has lance-shaped, bright green fronds with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The sori, which contain the spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, brown indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
