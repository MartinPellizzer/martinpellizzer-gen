    "intro": "Drosera penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It features slender, trailing stems that produce sticky, glandular hairs to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, pendulous flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique ability to digest insects makes it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
