    "intro": "Danthonia cunninghamii, commonly known as the coastal grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
