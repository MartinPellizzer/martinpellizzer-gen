    "intro": "Deguelia uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp holly or black holly, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and riparian zones. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
