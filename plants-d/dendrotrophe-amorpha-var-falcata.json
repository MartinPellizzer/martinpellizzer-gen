    "intro": "Dendrotrophe amorpha var. falcata, commonly known as the falcate goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of golden-yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
