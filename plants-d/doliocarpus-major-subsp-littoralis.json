    "intro": "Doliocarpus major subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and in coastal forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding."
