    "intro": "Daucus durieua, commonly known as the Durie's carrot, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many familiar edible plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its root system is less developed compared to other carrots, and it is not typically cultivated for its edible roots. Instead, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats."
