    "intro": "Dioscorea lecardii, commonly known as the LeCard's yam, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical, tuberous roots. These roots are the primary part used, though they are not typically cultivated for food due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
