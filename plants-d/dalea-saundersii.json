    "intro": "Dalea saundersii, commonly known as the Saunders' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically produces small, yellow to reddish-orange blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Dalea saundersii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
