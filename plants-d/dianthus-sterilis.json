    "intro": "Dianthus sterilis, commonly known as the barren carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its simple, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Dianthus sterilis is not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and evolutionary significance."
