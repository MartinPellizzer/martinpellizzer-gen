    "intro": "Davallia intermarginalis, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive margin with a narrow, contrasting band. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of rhizome scales. This fern is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
