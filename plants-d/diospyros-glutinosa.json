    "intro": "Diospyros glutinosa, commonly known as sticky ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are highly aromatic. Its wood is dense and valued for its durability and rich color, though it is rarely used commercially. Diospyros glutinosa thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
