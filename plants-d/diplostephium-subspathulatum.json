It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
