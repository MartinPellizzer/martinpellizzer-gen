    "intro": "Davallia solida f. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentella fern, is a variant of the hardy fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
