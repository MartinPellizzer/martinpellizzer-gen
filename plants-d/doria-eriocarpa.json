    "intro": "Doria eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit-bearing shrub, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are yellow when mature. Doria eriocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
