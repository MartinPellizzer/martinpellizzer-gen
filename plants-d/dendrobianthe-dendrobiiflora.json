    "intro": "Dendrobianthe dendrobiiflora, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a rare and unique species native to certain parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of specialized structures called pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
