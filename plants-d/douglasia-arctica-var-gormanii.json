    "intro": "Douglasia arctica var. gormanii, commonly known as the Arctic Douglasia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic tundra. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Arctic ecosystems."
