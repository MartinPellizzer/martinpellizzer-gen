    "intro": "Dryopteris gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched, spore-bearing stalks that emerge from a rhizome system. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching shape that gives the plant a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
