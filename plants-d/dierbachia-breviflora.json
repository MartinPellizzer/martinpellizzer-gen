It belongs to the family Marantaceae, which includes many ornamental plants known for their striking foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically borne on short, erect inflorescences. Its leaves are usually dark green and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dierbachia breviflora is primarily grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions and indirect light."
