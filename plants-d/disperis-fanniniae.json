    "intro": "Disperis fanniniae, commonly known as the Fannin's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
