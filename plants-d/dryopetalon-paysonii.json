    "intro": "Dryopetalon paysonii, commonly known as the Payson's dryopetalon, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
