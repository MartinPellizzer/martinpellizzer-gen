    "intro": "Drimys brasiliensis subsp. sylvatica, commonly known as the Brazilian wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
