    "intro": "Decarydendron helenae var. helenae, commonly known as Helen's decarydendron, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, woody stems with glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in an alternate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
