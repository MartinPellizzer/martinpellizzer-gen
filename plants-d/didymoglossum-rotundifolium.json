    "intro": "Didymoglossum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed didymoglossum, is a small, perennial grassland plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, two-lobed flowers. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions, often in open grasslands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
