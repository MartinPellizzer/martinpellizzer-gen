    "intro": "Drosera nitidula subsp. leucostigma, commonly known as the white-stemmed sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, sticky glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from its prey. Its leaves are usually short and clustered at the base, with a distinctive white or pale coloration. This subspecies is noted for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in marshy areas along riverbanks and wetlands."
