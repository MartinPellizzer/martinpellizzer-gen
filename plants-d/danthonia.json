    "intro": "Danthonia, commonly known as hairgrass, is a genus of perennial grasses belonging to the Poaceae family. These plants are characterized by their fine, hair-like leaves and are often found in moist, acidic soils. Danthonia species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, making them common in wetlands and grassy areas. They are well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in regions with cool, humid conditions. Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
