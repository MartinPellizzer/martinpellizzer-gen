    "intro": "Dryopteris aneitensis, commonly known as the Aneityn Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
