    "intro": "Dyckia pectinata, commonly known as the hairy Dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and they bear small white or pale green teeth along their edges. This plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, red or orange flowers. It is well adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
