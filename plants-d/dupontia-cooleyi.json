    "intro": "Dupontia cooleyi, commonly known as the Cooley's dunegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. Dupontia cooleyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
