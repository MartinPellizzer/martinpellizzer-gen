    "intro": "Dichapetalum angolense var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the Angola milk tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique, milky sap, which is a defining feature of the genus. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in racemes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
