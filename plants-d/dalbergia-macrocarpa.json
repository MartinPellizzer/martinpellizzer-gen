    "intro": "Dalbergia macrocarpa, commonly known as African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often emit a distinctive fragrance when crushed. Its flowers are small and clustered in racemes, typically appearing in yellow or greenish-white colors. The tree produces long, narrow pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
