    "intro": "Dampiera erecta, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a distinctive velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy habitats. Dampiera erecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
