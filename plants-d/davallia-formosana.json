    "intro": "Davallia formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan brake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Davallia formosana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
