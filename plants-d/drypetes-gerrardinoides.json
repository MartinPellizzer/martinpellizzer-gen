    "intro": "Drypetes gerrardinoides, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
