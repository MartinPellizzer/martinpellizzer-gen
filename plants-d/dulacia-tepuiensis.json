    "intro": "Dulacia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui dulacia, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to the high-altitude, rocky environments of the tepuis, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, Dulacia tepuiensis is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
