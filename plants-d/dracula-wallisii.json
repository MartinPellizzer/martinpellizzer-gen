    "intro": "Dracula wallisii, commonly known as the \"Vampire Orchid,\" is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and elongated, fleshy stems that often bear clusters of small, intricate flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Dracula wallisii is considered vulnerable in its native range."
