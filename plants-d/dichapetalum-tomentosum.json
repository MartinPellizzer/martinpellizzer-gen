    "intro": "Dichapetalum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves covered in fine white hairs, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and often have a somewhat succulent texture, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
