    "intro": "Dendrophthora subtrinervis, commonly known as the three-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments. Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the host tree's health and ecosystem dynamics."
