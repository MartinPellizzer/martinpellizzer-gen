    "intro": "Dactylorchis traunsteinerioides, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's dactyl orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
