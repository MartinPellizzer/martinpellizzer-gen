    "intro": "Dendrophthora roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and elongated, pale flowers. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in the humid, misty environments of cloud forests. Its survival depends on specific microclimatic conditions and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
