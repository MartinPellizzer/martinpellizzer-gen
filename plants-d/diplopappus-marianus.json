It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, two-parted fruits that resemble miniature parachutes, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
