    "intro": "Dipcadi arenarium, commonly known as the sand-dwelling squill, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem base with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the cooler months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments."
