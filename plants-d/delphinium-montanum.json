    "intro": "Delphinium montanum, commonly known as mountain larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of palmately lobed leaves, and it produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Delphinium montanum is also known for its toxicity, containing compounds that can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
