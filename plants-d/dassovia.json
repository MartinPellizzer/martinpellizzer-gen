It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Dassovia species are perennial herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
