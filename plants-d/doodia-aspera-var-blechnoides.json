    "intro": "Doodia aspera var. blechnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a variant of the huperzia fern found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings where a lush, green texture is desired."
