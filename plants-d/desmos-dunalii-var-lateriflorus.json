    "intro": "Desmos dunalii var. lateriflorus, commonly known as the coastal dune daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
