    "intro": "Dicoma arenaria, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are typically pale green or white. Dicoma arenaria is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
