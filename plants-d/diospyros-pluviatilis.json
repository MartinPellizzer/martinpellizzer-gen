    "intro": "Diospyros pluviatilis, commonly known as the rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and striking, umbrella-shaped foliage that provides dense shade. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Diospyros pluviatilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types."
