    "intro": "Dryopteris squamifera, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as Japan, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green with a scaly appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris squamifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
