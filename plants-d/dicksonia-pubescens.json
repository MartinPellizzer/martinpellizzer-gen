    "intro": "Dicksonia pubescens, commonly known as the soft tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used for propagation, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
