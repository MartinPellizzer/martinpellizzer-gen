It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pale pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
