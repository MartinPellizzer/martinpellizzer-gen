    "intro": "Delima tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly delima, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and survive in dry conditions. Delima tomentosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and drought tolerance."
