    "intro": "Disticholiparis gibbosa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that are often folded or pleated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is notable for its adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
