It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
