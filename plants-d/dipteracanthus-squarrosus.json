    "intro": "Dipteracanthus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
