    "intro": "Diporochna latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal diporochna, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, broad sepals that are often brightly colored, serving as a visual attractant for pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth texture and a deep green color. The inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a common feature in the Araceae family."
