    "intro": "Dieffenbachia cannifolia, commonly known as the Cannonball Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with contrasting white or yellow veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking foliage, it is a popular ornamental plant in indoor and outdoor settings."
