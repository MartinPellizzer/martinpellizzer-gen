    "intro": "Delphinium anthora, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Delphinium anthora is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
