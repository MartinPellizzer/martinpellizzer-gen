    "intro": "Dryopteris kungiana, commonly known as the Kung's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
