    "intro": "Dalbergia cambodiana, commonly known as Cambodian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia and Vietnam. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing flat, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its valuable timber, it is also a species of concern for conservation efforts."
