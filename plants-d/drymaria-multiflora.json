    "intro": "Drymaria multiflora, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
