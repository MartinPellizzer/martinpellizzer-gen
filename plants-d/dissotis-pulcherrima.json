    "intro": "Dissotis pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dissotis pulcherrima is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
