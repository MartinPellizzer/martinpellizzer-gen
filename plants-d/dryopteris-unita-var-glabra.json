    "intro": "Dryopteris unita var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth fronds that lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shape that resembles a shield, giving it its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
