    "intro": "Dicksonia punctilobula f. schizophylla, commonly known as the Split-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, divided fronds that give it a unique appearance compared to other tree ferns. The plant has a tall, slender trunk with a fibrous, bark-like covering that develops as it matures. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas throughout New Zealand."
