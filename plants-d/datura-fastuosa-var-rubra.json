It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped, velvety red or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. The plant contains toxic alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine, though it requires careful handling due to its potent effects."
