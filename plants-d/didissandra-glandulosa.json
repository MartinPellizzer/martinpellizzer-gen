    "intro": "Didissandra glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular didissandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, glandular leaves that are often covered in small, sticky bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Didissandra glandulosa is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments within the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
