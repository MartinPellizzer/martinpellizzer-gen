    "intro": "Draba incana f. robusta, commonly known as the robust dwarf cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features dense, basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are somewhat succulent in texture. It blooms from spring to early summer, producing clusters of yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils."
