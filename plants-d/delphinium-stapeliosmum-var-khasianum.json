    "intro": "Delphinium stapeliosmum var. khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It features tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
