It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used for vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread and establish in suitable habitats. Didymoglossum wesselsboeri is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
