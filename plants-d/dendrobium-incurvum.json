    "intro": "Dendrobium incurvum, commonly known as the curved lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a cane-like stem with numerous pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with a distinctive, curving lip that gives it its common name. Dendrobium incurvum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
