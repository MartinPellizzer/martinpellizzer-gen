    "intro": "Discaria prostrata var. inermis, commonly known as the silky dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Australia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion puffs. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a silvery-blue hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
