    "intro": "Dicerolepis pedunculata, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dicerolepis pedunculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
