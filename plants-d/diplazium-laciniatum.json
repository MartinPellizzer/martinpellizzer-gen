    "intro": "Diplazium laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm long, with a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Diplazium laciniatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
