    "intro": "Dorstenia pierrei, commonly known as the Guatemalan spider plant, is a unique member of the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a spider's web. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a helical pattern along a central stem. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Dorstenia pierrei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid environments."
