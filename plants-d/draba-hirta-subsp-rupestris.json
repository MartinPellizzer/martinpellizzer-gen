    "intro": "Draba hirta subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of hairy, linear leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or gravelly slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
