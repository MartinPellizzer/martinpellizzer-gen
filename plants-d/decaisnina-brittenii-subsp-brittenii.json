    "intro": "Decaisnina brittenii subsp. brittenii, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
