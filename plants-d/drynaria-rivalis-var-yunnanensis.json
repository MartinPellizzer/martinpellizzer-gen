    "intro": "Drynaria rivalis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cliff fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to China. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense, dark green fronds that are often clustered in tufts. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced and have a leathery texture. This plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, typically on cliffs or in forested areas with high humidity. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
