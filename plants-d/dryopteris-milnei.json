    "intro": "Dryopteris milnei, commonly known as the Milne's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Dryopteris milnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
