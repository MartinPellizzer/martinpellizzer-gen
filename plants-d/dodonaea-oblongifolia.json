    "intro": "Dodonaea oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hopwood, is a shrub native to Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Dodonaea oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
