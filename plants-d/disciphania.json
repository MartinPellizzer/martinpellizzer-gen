    "intro": "Disciphania, commonly known as the bladdernut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Disciphania glabra, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Disciphania species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are adapted to thrive in humid climates."
