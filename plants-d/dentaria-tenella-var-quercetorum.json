    "intro": "Dentaria tenella var. quercetorum, commonly known as the oakleaf toothache plant, is a perennial herbaceous species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its common name derives from its historical use in treating toothaches, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
