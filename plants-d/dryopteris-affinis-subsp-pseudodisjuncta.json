    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis subsp. pseudodisjuncta, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability."
