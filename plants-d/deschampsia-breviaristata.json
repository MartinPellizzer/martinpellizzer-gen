    "intro": "Deschampsia breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silky leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
