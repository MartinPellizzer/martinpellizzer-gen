    "intro": "Draba oligosperma var. juniperina, commonly known as the Juniperleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat."
