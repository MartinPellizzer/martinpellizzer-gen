    "intro": "Dichroa platyphylla, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and a distinctive two-toned appearance when viewed from different angles. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
