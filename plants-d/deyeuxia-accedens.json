It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often densely packed, with narrow, linear leaves that are smooth and sometimes slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Deyeuxia accedens is often found in association with other wetland grasses and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
