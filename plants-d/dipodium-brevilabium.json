    "intro": "Dipodium brevilabium, commonly known as the narrow-lipped dipodium, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically features a short, stocky rhizome with a few pairs of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
