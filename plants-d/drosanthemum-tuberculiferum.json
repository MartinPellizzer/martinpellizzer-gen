    "intro": "Drosanthemum tuberculiferum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded tubercles, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Drosanthemum tuberculiferum is drought-tolerant and often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
