    "intro": "Digitaria perpusilla, commonly known as little fingergrass, is a small annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its delicate, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in low-nutrient environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
