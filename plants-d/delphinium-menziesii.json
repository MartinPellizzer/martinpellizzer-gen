    "intro": "Delphinium menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium menziesii is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in full sun."
