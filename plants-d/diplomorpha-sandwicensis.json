It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
