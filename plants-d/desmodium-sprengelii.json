    "intro": "Desmodium sprengelii, commonly known as the velvet bean or small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems. Additionally, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
