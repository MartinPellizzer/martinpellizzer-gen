It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves and small, red-orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features include a woody structure with smooth bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The fruit is edible, though some varieties may have astringent properties when unripe."
