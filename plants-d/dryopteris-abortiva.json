    "intro": "Dryopteris abortiva, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with new growth emerging from the base each year."
