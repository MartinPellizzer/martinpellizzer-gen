    "intro": "Drynaria elastica, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its long, flexible fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to climb and spread along tree trunks or other supports. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in horticulture. Drynaria elastica is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
