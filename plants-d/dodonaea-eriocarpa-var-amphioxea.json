    "intro": "Dodonaea eriocarpa var. amphioxea, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a waxy texture. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
