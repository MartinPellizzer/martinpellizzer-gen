    "intro": "Dianthus orientalis subsp. ketzkhovelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhovel carnation, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, double-layered petals that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
