    "intro": "Dianthus aridus, commonly known as the desert carnation, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Dianthus aridus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
