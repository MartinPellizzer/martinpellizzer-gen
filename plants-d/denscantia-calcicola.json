    "intro": "Denscantia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone denscantia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
