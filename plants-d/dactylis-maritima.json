    "intro": "Dactylis maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate flooding. Its ability to stabilize coastal soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
