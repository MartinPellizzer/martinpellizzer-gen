    "intro": "Danthoniopsis pruinosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender pruinose muirgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense spikes, and it is often found in association with other native flora. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
