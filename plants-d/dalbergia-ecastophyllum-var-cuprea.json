    "intro": "Dalbergia ecastophyllum var. cuprea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly pubescent surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods containing elongated seeds. The species is often found in lowland evergreen forests and is known for its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting."
