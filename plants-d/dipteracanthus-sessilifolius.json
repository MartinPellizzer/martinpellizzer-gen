    "intro": "Dipteracanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
