    "intro": "Diospyros japonica, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is dense and highly valued for its durability. Diospyros japonica is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor."
