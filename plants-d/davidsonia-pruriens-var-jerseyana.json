    "intro": "Davidsonia pruriens var. jerseyana, commonly known as the Jersey Davidsonia, is a unique member of the Proteaceae family native to the coastal regions of southern New Zealand. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, woody stems that often branch out into a dense, bushy form. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing edible seeds. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it an important species in its native habitat."
