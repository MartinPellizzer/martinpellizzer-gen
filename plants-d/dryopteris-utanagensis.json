    "intro": "Dryopteris utanagensis, commonly known as the Utanagen fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native habitat."
