    "intro": "Drymaria grandis, commonly known as the large sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Drymaria grandis is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability."
