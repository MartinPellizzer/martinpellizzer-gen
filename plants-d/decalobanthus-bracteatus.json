    "intro": "Decalobanthus bracteatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings. Decalobanthus bracteatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
