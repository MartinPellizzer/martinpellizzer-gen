    "intro": "Desmodium arechavaletae, commonly known as the Mexican velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by cylindrical, bean-like pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Desmodium arechavaletae is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
