    "intro": "Dianella revoluta var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax lily, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in suitable environments."
