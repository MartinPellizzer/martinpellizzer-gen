It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both ecological and medicinal interest. Derris microphylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
