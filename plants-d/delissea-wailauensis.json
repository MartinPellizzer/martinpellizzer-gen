    "intro": "Delissea wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
