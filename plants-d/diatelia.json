It is characterized by its showy, water-lily-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Diatelia species are aquatic or semi-aquatic, with broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. These plants play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
