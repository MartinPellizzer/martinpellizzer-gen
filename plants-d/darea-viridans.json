    "intro": "Darea viridans, commonly known as the green lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, greenish layer on tree trunks, rocks, and soil, often in temperate regions. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic algae and a fungus, which together carry out essential metabolic functions. Its structure includes a thallus composed of a gelatinous matrix with interwoven fungal hyphae. Darea viridans plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in forest ecosystems."
