    "intro": "Dichocarpum dicarpon var. univalve, commonly known as the single-valved bellflower, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, single-valved capsule that opens to release its seeds, a unique feature among its relatives. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with five sepals that are often reflexed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
