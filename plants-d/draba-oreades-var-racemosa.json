    "intro": "Draba oreades var. racemosa, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces racemes of bright yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
