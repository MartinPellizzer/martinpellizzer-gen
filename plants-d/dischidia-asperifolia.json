It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, raised bumps. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits. This plant is often grown as a decorative foliage plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
