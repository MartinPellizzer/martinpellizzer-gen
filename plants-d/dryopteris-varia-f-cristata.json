    "intro": "Dryopteris varia f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate wood fern, is a varietal form of the variable wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with a dense, clustered arrangement of fronds. Its fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil."
