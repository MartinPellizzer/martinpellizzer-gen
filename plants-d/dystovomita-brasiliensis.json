It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with smooth, glabrous bark and lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. The botanical features of Dystovomita brasiliensis make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
