    "intro": "Daphne cannabina var. bholua, commonly known as the Himalayan daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often exuding a milky sap when injured. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
