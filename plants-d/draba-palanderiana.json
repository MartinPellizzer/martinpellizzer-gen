    "intro": "Draba palanderiana, commonly known as the Palander's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to alpine regions of Scandinavia and is typically found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a single inflorescence. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
