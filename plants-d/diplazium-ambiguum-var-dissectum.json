    "intro": "Diplazium ambiguum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens or as a houseplant."
