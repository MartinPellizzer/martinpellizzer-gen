    "intro": "Digitaria subsulcata, commonly known as blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and culms that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, leathery florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments, impacting native plant communities."
