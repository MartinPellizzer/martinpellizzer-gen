    "intro": "Dendromyza erecta, commonly known as the upright wood lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on the bark of trees in temperate forest environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is dense and crust-like, often forming a compact, flattened growth. It thrives in humid conditions and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
