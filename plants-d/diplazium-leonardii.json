    "intro": "Diplazium leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into small, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium leonardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
