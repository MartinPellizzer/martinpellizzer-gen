    "intro": "Dentaria maxima f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered toothache plant, is a rare variant of the toothache plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers that contrast with its green foliage. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is known for its historical use in traditional medicine. Its leaves are succulent and have a peppery taste, similar to its common relative, Erysimum. This form is less common than the typical green-flowered variety and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
