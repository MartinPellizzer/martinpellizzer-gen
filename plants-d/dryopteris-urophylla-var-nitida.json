    "intro": "Dryopteris urophylla var. nitida, commonly known as the silver fern, is a variant of the Japanese shield fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray fronds that give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
