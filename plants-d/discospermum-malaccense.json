    "intro": "Discospermum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca starfruit or Malabar starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically yellow or orange when mature. The plant produces small, green, oval leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The fruit, while not as commonly consumed as the common starfruit, is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
