    "intro": "Dalbergia noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Dalbergia noldeae is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
