    "intro": "Dryopteris andicola f. lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's wood fern, is a fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in compact, club-like structures called soruses, which are located on the undersides of the fronds."
