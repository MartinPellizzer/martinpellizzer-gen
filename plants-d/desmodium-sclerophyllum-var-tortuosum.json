    "intro": "Desmodium sclerophyllum var. tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted-sheath desmodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a unique, twisted sheath at the base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The species is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
