    "intro": "Diphalangium, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Diphalangium plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
