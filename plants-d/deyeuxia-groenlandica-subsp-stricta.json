    "intro": "Deyeuxia groenlandica subsp. stricta, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
