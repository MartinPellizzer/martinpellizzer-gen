    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata subsp. elodes, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
