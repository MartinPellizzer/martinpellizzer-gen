    "intro": "Dryas crenulata var. subholophylla, commonly known as the subholophyllous dryas, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance."
