    "intro": "Dryopteris deparioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to form dense, mat-like growths, making it suitable for ground cover. Its fronds are biennal, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
