    "intro": "Dieffenbachia longispatha, commonly known as the long-spurred dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
