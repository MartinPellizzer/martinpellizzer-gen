    "intro": "Dianthus hoppei, commonly known as the Himalayan campion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dianthus hoppei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful blooms."
