    "intro": "Doellingeria \u00d7 sekimotoi, commonly known as the hybrid giant horsetail, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Doellingeria torreyi* and *Doellingeria filifera*. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in jointed, segmented structures that resemble the ancient horsetail plants. The plant lacks true flowers and reproduces vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a non-flowering, clonal species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies entirely on propagation through its underground stems."
