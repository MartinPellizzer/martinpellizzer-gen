    "intro": "Doronicum eriorrhizon, commonly known as the downy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, especially along the veins, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellow flowers with prominent white veins, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. Doronicum eriorrhizon is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
