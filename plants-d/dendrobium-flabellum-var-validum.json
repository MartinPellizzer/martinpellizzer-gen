It features long, cane-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
