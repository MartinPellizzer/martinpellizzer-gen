It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
