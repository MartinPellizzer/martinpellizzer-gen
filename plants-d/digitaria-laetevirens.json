It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in warm climates and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit contribute to its ecological and agronomic significance."
