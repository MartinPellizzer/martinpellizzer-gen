    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy leathery fern, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant forms dense clumps and thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually divided into segments, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
