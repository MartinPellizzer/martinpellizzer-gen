    "intro": "Dryopteris propinqua, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only sterile fronds and the second year producing fertile spore-bearing fronds. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage, which helps it spread and colonize new areas. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
