It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that give the plant a dense, lush appearance."
