    "intro": "Dryopteris comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access the necessary moisture and light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local biodiversity of its native habitat."
