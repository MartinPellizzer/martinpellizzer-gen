    "intro": "Dracaena deremensis, commonly known as the Janzen dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, long, strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a reddish or bronze tinge along the edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. Dracaena deremensis is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties."
