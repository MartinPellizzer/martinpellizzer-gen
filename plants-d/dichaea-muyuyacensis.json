    "intro": "Dichaea muyuyacensis, commonly known as the Muyuyacensis Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its inflorescences are often adorned with small, hairy bracts. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
