    "intro": "Desmodium lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's burrlegume, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces hairy, three-lobed seed pods. Desmodium lindheimeri is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
