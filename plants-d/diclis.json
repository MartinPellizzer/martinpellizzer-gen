    "intro": "Diclis, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Diclis species typically have opposite leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that are sometimes edible. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
