    "intro": "Dracaena neocaledonica, commonly known as the laceleaf dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and intricately veined leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena neocaledonica is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
