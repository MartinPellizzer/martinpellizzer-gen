    "intro": "Deparia petersenii subsp. deflexa, commonly known as the bent-leaf water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curve downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
