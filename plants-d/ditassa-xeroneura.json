    "intro": "Ditassa xeroneura, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
