    "intro": "Dryopteris extensa, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris extensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its lush, architectural foliage."
