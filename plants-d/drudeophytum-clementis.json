    "intro": "Drudeophytum clementis, commonly known as the Clement's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, bioluminescent\u82b1\u6735 that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its reproductive cycle is unique, involving a symbiotic relationship with a particular species of fungal mycelium. Due to habitat destruction, Drudeophytum clementis is classified as critically endangered, making it a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
