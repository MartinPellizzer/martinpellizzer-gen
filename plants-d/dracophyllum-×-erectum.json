    "intro": "Dracophyllum \u00d7 erectum, commonly known as the erect dwarf heath, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and montane habitats, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in the lower elevations of the South Island, where it thrives in mild, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
