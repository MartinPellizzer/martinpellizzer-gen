    "intro": "Diplazium acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often submerged, with some fronds extending above the water surface. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates while facilitating nutrient absorption. Diplazium acrostichoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
