    "intro": "Dryopteris paravaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive narrow leaflet arrangement. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris paravaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
