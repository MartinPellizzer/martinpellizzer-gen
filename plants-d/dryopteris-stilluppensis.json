    "intro": "Dryopteris stilluppensis, commonly known as the Stillup's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its robust fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
