    "intro": "Dryopteris ochropteroides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with golden or bronze-colored veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the forest understory."
