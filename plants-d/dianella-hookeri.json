    "intro": "Dianella hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's lily or narrow-leaved flax lily, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Dianella hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
