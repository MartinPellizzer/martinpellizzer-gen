    "intro": "Dryopteris germaniana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a fern species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its overall compact structure."
