    "intro": "Dalea versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalea versicolor is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
