    "intro": "Dimorphandra gigantea, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large tropical tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed trunk and broad, bipinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
