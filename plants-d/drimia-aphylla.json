    "intro": "Drimia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless dragon's tongue, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which appear in late summer. It has no true leaves, with only small, scale-like structures at the base of the stems. Drimia aphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
