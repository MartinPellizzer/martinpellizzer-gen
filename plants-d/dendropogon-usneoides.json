    "intro": "Dendropogon usneoides, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on tree bark, particularly in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a dense, moss-like growth that resembles a beard, hence its common name. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution. This lichen plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
