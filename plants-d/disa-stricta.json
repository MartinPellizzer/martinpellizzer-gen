It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Disa stricta is known for its ephemeral blooming habit, often flowering only for a short period during the rainy season."
