    "intro": "Diosma capitata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
