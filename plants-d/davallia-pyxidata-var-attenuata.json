    "intro": "Davallia pyxidata var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. This ornamental fern is popular in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ease of care."
