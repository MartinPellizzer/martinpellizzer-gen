    "intro": "Dianthus subulosus, commonly known as the mountain pinks, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Dianthus subulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
