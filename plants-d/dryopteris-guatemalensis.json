    "intro": "Dryopteris guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and extensively branched, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a rough texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
