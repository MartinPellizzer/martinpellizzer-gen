    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. alborosacea, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America. It features a slender, grass-like stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower with a distinctive greenish throat. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
