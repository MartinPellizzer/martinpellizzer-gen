    "intro": "Drynaria exsul, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest areas, showing a preference for humid environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its hardy nature. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is notable for its lack of sterile fronds, giving it its common name."
