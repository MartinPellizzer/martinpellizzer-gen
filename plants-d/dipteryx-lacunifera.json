    "intro": "Dipteryx lacunifera, commonly known as the yellow mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces elongated pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the timber industry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
