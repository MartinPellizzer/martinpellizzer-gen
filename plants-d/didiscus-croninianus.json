    "intro": "Didiscus croninianus, commonly known as the Cronin's didiscus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, spurred shape. Didiscus croninianus is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
