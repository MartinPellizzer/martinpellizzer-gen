    "intro": "Desmoncus caespitosus, commonly known as the hairy cup-lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dense, velvety thallus covered in short, upright hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, typical of lichens. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
