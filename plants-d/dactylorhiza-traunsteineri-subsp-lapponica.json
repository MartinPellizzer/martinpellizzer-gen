    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to northern regions of Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies thrives in acidic, peaty soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
