    "intro": "Dendrobium flagellum, commonly known as the whip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often branched stems that resemble a whip, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically blooming in the spring. Dendrobium flagellum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
