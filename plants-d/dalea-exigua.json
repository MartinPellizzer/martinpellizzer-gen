    "intro": "Dalea exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs. Dalea exigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
