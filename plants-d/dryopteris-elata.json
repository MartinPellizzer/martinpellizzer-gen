    "intro": "Dryopteris elata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium."
