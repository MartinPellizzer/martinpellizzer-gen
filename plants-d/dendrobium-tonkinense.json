    "intro": "Dendrobium tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the rainy season. Dendrobium tonkinense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for horticultural purposes."
