    "intro": "Dicliptera coerulea, commonly known as blue-leaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, blue-green foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
