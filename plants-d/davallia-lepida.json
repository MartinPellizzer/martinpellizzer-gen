    "intro": "Davallia lepida, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, lacy appearance, often with a pale, almost translucent coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Davallia lepida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings."
