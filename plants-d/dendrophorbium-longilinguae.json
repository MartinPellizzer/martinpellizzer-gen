    "intro": "Dendrophorbium longilinguae, commonly known as the long-tongued orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The plant's most distinctive feature is its elongated, tubular nectar spur, which is adapted to accommodate its primary pollinators, such as certain species of bees and wasps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it often grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Dendrophorbium longilinguae is considered a rare and endangered species."
