    "intro": "Dianthus arenarius var. bohemicus, commonly known as the Bohemian sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Czech Republic and parts of Central Europe. It typically features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of pink to reddish-pink flowers. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid or semi-arid environments."
