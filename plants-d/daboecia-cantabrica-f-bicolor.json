    "intro": "Daboecia cantabrica f. bicolor, commonly known as the Cantabrian heath, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, with white and pink flowers that contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and rocky slopes. Its floral structure consists of five petals and is adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
