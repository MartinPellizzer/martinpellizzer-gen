    "intro": "Dicliptera cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba dicliptera, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
