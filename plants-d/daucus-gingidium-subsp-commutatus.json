    "intro": "Daucus gingidium subsp. commutatus, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, including parts of Turkey and the Caucasus. The plant features a taproot that is typically smaller and more fibrous than that of cultivated carrots. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of other members of the Apiaceae family. The flowers are small, white, and arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot genus."
