    "intro": "Dupatya fluitans, commonly known as the floating fern, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that allow it to spread across the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Dupatya fluitans is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
