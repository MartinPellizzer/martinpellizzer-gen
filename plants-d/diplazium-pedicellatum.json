    "intro": "Diplazium pedicellatum, commonly known as the creeping button fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of fiddlehead-like fronds. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
