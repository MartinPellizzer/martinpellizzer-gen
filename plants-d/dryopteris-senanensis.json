    "intro": "Dryopteris senanensis, commonly known as the Senanese wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
