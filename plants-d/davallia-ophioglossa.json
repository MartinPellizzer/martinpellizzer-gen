    "intro": "Davallia ophioglossa, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow powder. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
