    "intro": "Dyssodia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, smooth, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small yellow flowers are typically grouped into dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Dyssodia integrifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
