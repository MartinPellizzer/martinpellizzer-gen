It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
