    "intro": "Decaneurum scabridum, commonly known as the roughleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, rough-textured hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
