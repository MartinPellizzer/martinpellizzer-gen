    "intro": "Dendrobium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to China. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers come in shades of white, yellow, and pink, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Dendrobium yunnanense is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
