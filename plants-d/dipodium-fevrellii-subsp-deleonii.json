    "intro": "Dipodium fevrellii subsp. deleonii, commonly known as the Del\u00e9on's dipodium, is a rare and endemic fern species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
