    "intro": "Dactylaena pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered dactylaena, is a member of the Palmae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, palm-like plant that typically grows in wet, swampy areas. The plant has a short trunk and is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
