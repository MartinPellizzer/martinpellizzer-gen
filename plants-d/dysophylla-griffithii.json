    "intro": "Dysophylla griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Due to its unique adaptations, Dysophylla griffithii is often found in alpine meadows and canyons at elevations above 3,000 meters."
