    "intro": "Dorstenia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved tortoise shell, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble tortoise shells, which help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Dorstenia brevifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
