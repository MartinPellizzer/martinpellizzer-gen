    "intro": "Dryopteris confusa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale brown to reddish fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fertile fronds produce spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Dryopteris confusa is a perennial plant that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
