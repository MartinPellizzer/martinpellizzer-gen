It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to eastern North America. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a pale, silky appearance due to the dense covering of trichomes. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after plant for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
