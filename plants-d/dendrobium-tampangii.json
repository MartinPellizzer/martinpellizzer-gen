    "intro": "Dendrobium tampangii, commonly known as the Tampangii orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, branching stems that can reach up to several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinct lip, and they bloom in clusters during the wet season. Dendrobium tampangii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
