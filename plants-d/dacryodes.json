    "intro": "Dacryodes, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that often appear in clusters. Dacryodes species typically produce woody fruits containing one or two seeds, and some species are valued for their aromatic resins. These plants play important ecological roles in their native habitats and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
