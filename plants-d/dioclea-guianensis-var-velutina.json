    "intro": "Dioclea guianensis var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a climbing shrub native to tropical South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and produces yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The plant's fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal seeds enclosed in a fleshy, reddish aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
