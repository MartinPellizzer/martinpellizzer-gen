    "intro": "Dendrophthoe sarcophylla, commonly known as the red root dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fruits and excrete the seeds elsewhere. Dendrophthoe sarcophylla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with dense vegetation."
