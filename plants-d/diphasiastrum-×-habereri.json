    "intro": "Diphasiastrum \u00d7 habereri, commonly known as the hybrid barren stemmed grass, is a sterile, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Diphasiastrum complanatum and Diphasiastrum sutchuenense, characterized by its lack of flowers and reduced foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Its botanical features include thin, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Poaceae family. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
