    "intro": "Dennettia tripetala, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
