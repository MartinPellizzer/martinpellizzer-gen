    "intro": "Dracaena letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena letestui is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
