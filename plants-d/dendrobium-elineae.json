    "intro": "Dendrobium elineae, commonly known as the Elinea orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium elineae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
