    "intro": "Doronicum bellidifolium, commonly known as the bellflower doronicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period, often in late spring."
