    "intro": "Dalbergia intibucana, commonly known as the Honduras rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rarity and high demand, it is also considered an endangered species."
