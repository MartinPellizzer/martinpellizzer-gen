    "intro": "Diplopappus ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and leathery. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and drought. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
