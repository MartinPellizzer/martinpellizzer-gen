    "intro": "Dipsacus atratus, commonly known as the black cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered seed heads that resemble a cock's comb, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the distinctive, prickly fruit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges. Dipsacus atratus is commonly found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
