It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and broad, palmate leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
