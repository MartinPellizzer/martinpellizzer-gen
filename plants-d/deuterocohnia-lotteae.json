    "intro": "Deuterocohnia lotteae, commonly known as the Lotte's moss campion, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the Andes mountains. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing on rocky slopes or in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
