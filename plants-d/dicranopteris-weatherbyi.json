    "intro": "Dicranopteris weatherbyi, commonly known as the Weatherby's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
