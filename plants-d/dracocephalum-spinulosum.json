It features upright, branched stems covered with stiff, spinose hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, hairy textures, contributing to its rugged appearance. Dracocephalum spinulosum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
