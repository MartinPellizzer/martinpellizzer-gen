    "intro": "Dracocephalum kafiristanicum, commonly known as Kafiristan skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to high-altitude environments with cool and dry conditions."
