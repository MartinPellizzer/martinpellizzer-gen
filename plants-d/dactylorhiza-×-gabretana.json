    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 gabretana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza maculata and Dactylorhiza lapponica. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The botanical characteristics of Dactylorhiza \u00d7 gabretana reflect its adaptation to wetland habitats, with specialized roots that aid in nutrient absorption in waterlogged soils."
