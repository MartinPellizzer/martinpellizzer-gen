    "intro": "Dendrobium rosellum, commonly known as the Rosellum orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Dendrobium rosellum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
