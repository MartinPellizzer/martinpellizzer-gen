    "intro": "Draba gilliesii subvar. shannoniorum, commonly known as the Shannon's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Scottish Highlands. It typically reaches a height of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy habitats. This subvariety is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution."
