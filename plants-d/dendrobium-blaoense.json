    "intro": "Dendrobium blaoense, commonly known as the Biao Mountain orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this endangered species from habitat loss."
