    "intro": "Danthonia thunbergii, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Danthonia thunbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
