    "intro": "Diplopterygium deflexum, commonly known as the drooping holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, drooping fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
