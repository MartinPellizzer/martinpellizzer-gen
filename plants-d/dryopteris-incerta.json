    "intro": "Dryopteris incerta, commonly known as the uncertain wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorus. Dryopteris incerta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
