    "intro": "Doryopteris muralis, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant thrives in moist, humid environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, round structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris muralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
