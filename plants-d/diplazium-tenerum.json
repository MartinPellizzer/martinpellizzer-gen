    "intro": "Diplazium tenerum, commonly known as the slender chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that grow in a cascading pattern. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, leathery scales, which help protect it from environmental stress. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, lance-shaped segments that give the plant its elegant, fern-like appearance."
