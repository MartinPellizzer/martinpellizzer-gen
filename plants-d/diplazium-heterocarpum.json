It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds."
