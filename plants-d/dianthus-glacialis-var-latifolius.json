    "intro": "Dianthus glacialis var. latifolius, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical Dianthus glacialis, giving it a slightly different appearance. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh ecosystems."
