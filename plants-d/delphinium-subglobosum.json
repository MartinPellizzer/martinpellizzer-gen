    "intro": "Delphinium subglobosum, commonly known as the globular larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium subglobosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its toxic nature, due to the presence of alkaloids, requires caution when handling or planting near livestock and pets."
