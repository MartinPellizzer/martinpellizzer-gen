    "intro": "Desmodium gyrans, commonly known as the dancing plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique ability to move its leaves in response to light, a phenomenon called nyctinasty. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pink or white flowers. Its roots are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment. Desmodium gyrans is often cultivated as a forage crop and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and dynamic movement."
