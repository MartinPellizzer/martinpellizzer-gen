    "intro": "Dryopteris heterophlebia, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive variation in leaflet size and shape along the frond. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
