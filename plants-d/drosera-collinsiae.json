    "intro": "Drosera collinsiae, commonly known as the Collins' sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
