    "intro": "Dendrochilum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tree orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrochilum stenophyllum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings."
