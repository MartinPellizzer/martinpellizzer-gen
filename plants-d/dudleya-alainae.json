    "intro": "Dudleya alainae, commonly known as the Alain's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
