    "intro": "Diplazium chittagongense, commonly known as the Chittagong spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Diplazium chittagongense is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar."
