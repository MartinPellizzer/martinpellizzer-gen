    "intro": "Donax bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a vital role in coastal ecosystem stability. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Donax bengalensis is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and support biodiversity in mangrove habitats."
