It typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composed of two upper petals and three lower ones, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Delphinium pusillum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
