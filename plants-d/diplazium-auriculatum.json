    "intro": "Diplazium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium auriculatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
