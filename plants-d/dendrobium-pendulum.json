    "intro": "Dendrobium pendulum, commonly known as the weeping orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, pendant stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually strap-like and arranged spirally along the stem. Dendrobium pendulum is popular in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
