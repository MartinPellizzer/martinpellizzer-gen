    "intro": "Drosera nitidula subsp. allantostigma, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. Its leaves are linear and often curved, with a dense covering of digestive secretions. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
