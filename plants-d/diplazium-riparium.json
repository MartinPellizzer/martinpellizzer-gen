It has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. The plant is characterized by its rhizomes that form dense mats on the bottom of ponds and streams. Diplazium riparium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis. It is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
