    "intro": "Dryopteris mingetsuensis, commonly known as the moonlight wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
