    "intro": "Dryopteris subtetragona var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate, and often serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
