    "intro": "Deguelia platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leaved deguelia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Deguelia platyptera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
