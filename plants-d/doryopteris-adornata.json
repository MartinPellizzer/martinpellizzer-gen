    "intro": "Doryopteris adornata, commonly known as the adorned wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Doryopteris adornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
