It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant produces long, wiry pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Dendrobium whewellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
