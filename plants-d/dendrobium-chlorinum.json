    "intro": "Dendrobium chlorinum, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and lack of showy blooms make it a distinctive member of the orchid family. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
