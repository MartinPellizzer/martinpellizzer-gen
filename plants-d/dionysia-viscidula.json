    "intro": "Dionysia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky Dionysia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Dionysia viscidula thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
