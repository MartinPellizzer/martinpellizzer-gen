    "intro": "Dicliptera formosa, commonly known as the beautiful dicliptera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny, pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Dicliptera formosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatch or fodder in its native habitats."
