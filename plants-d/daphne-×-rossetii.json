    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 rossetii, commonly known as the rose daphne, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Daphne mezereum and Daphne corynophora. It is a deciduous shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the western Mediterranean, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Its ornamental value lies in its showy blooms and aromatic foliage, making it a popular choice in gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling and placement."
