    "intro": "Dalbergia obliquifoliolata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with oblique leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
