    "intro": "Deverra musilii, commonly known as the musk fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that ripen to a yellowish-orange color. The fruit has a mild, slightly sweet flavor and is often used in culinary applications. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
