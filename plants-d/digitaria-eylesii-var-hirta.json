    "intro": "Digitaria eylesii var. hirta, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Hairy fingergrass is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
