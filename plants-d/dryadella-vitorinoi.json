    "intro": "Dryadella vitorinoi, commonly known as the Vitorino's dryad, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep pink to violet. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dryadella vitorinoi is considered a species of conservation concern."
