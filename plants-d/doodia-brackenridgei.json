    "intro": "Doodia brackenridgei, commonly known as the brackenridge's water fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doodia brackenridgei plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
