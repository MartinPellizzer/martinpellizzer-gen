It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system and a rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties."
