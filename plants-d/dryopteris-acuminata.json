It features a robust rhizome system that supports its dense, upright fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
