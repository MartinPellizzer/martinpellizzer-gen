    "intro": "Deparia albosquamata, commonly known as the white-scaled wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
