    "intro": "Dryopteris euaensis, commonly known as the Eua Island wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
