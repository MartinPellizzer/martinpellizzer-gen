    "intro": "Dryopteris simplicifolia, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a dense, lush ground cover."
