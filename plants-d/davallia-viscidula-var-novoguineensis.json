    "intro": "Davallia viscidula var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea Davallia, is a terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It features delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting."
