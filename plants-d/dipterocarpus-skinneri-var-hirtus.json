It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and elongated, oval-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically hairy on the underside, giving the plant its varietal name. It produces heavy, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in rainforest ecosystems. This species is valued for its timber but is also threatened by habitat loss and overexploitation."
