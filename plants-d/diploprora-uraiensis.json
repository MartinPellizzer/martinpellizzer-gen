    "intro": "Diploprora uraiensis, commonly known as the Ura\u00efs orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are notable for their vibrant colors and complex patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Diploprora uraiensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
