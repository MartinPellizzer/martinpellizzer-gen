    "intro": "Dicarpellum pronyense, commonly known as the Prony's dicarpellum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Dicarpellaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features two distinct carpels. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a trait common in high-altitude flora. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Dicarpellum pronyense is considered a vulnerable species."
