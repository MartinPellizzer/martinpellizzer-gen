    "intro": "Dicranostigma henanense, commonly known as the Henan rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
