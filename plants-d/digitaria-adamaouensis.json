    "intro": "Digitaria adamaouensis, commonly known as the Sahel grass, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry environments. Digitaria adamaouensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
