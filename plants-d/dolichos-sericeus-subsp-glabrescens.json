    "intro": "Dolichos sericeus subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky cowpea, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The subspecies glabrescens differs from the typical Dolichos sericeus by having a more glabrous (smooth) appearance, particularly on its stems and leaves. It produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some parts of the world. This plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings."
