    "intro": "Digitaria melinoides, commonly known as African grass or melinoides grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaf blades, and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Digitaria melinoides is valued for its use in livestock feed and as a forage grass in agricultural systems."
