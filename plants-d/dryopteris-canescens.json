    "intro": "Dryopteris canescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered with a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while also storing nutrients. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
