    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage with a bluish sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and pastureland due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
