    "intro": "Dorstenia letestui, commonly known as the \"Fairy Flute,\" is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling stems that resemble the shape of a flute, often curling and twisting as the plant matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Dorstenia letestui is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
