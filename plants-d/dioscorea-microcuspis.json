    "intro": "Dioscorea microcuspis, commonly known as the small-cusped yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some cultures. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its tubers are often cultivated for their starchy content, though they require careful preparation to avoid toxicity. The species is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in traditional agriculture."
