    "intro": "Dryopteris diversiloba subvar. lanceola, commonly known as the lance-leaf wood fern, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters, or sori, on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
