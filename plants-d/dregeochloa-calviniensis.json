    "intro": "Dregeochloa calviniensis, commonly known as the Calvini's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered with a fine layer of hair, giving them a slightly rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local grassland ecosystems."
