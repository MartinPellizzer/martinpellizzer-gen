    "intro": "Duckeella, commonly known as the red-flowered duckeella, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The genus is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Duckeella species typically have strap-like leaves that form a rosette, and they are often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
