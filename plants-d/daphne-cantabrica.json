    "intro": "Daphne cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Daphne cantabrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
