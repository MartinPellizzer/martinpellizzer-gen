    "intro": "Dendrobium mitriferum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dendrobium, is a rare and unique orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil, and thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features elongated, cane-like stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted to conserve moisture in its mountainous habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
