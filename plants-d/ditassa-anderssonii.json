    "intro": "Ditassa anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blossoms that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
