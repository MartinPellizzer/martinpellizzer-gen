    "intro": "Daucus vulgaris var. polygamus, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces a characteristic umbel of white flowers with a single red or purple flower at the center. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its seeds are small, dry, and have a distinctive structure that aids in wind dispersal. The plant is also known for its aromatic, carrot-like odor when crushed."
