It features delicate, arching fronds with a slender, lance-shaped appearance, and its rhizomes are covered in a dense mat of roots. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a distinctive ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is popular as a houseplant. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
