It is a climbing shrub characterized by its compound leaves that resemble oak leaves, with serrated edges and a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
