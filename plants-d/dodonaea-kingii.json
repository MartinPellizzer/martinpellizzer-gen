    "intro": "Dodonaea kingii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Dodonaea kingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
