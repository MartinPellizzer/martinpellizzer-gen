    "intro": "Diplotaenia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They produce small, greenish or reddish flowers arranged in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. Diplotaenia species are generally herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments."
