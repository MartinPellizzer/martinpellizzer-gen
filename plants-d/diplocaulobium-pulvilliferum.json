    "intro": "Diplocaulobium pulvilliferum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structures and a distinctive growth habit that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. The plant's stems are covered in fine, hairy structures called pulvillae, which aid in water retention and protection from desiccation. It typically grows in cool, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This liverwort is an important component of microhabitats, providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
