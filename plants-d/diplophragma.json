    "intro": "Diplophragma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Diplophragma species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
