    "intro": "Diuris protena, commonly known as the pink spider-orchid, is an Australian orchid species native to the southeastern regions of the country. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its distinctive flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique, narrow labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. Diuris protena is a perennial herb that blooms during the spring and early summer months."
