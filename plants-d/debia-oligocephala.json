It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Debia oligocephala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
