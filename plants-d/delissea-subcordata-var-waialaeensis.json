    "intro": "Delissea subcordata var. waialaeensis, commonly known as the Kauai silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and silvery, hairy foliage. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers, typically blooming once every few years. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical wonder."
