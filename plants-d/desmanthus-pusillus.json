    "intro": "Desmanthus pusillus, commonly known as the small desmanthus, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also valued for its role in soil enrichment."
