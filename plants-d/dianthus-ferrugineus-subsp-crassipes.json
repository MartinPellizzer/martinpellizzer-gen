    "intro": "Dianthus ferrugineus subsp. crassipes, commonly known as the rough pinks or rock pinks, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with prominent, fringed petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
