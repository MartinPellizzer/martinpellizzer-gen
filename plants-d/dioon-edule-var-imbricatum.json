    "intro": "Dioon edule var. imbricatum, commonly known as the Mexican giant cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate with minimal frost. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
