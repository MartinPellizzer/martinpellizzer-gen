    "intro": "Ditaxis fendleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with thick, woody stems adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
