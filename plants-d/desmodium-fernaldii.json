    "intro": "Desmodium fernaldii, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility. Desmodium fernaldii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
