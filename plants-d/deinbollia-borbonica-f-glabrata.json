It is characterized by its glabrous, or hairless, leaves and small, dark green foliage. The plant produces small white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
