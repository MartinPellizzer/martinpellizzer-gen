    "intro": "Dopatrium acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed dopatrium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
