It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive club-shaped lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
