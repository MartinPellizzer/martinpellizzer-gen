    "intro": "Diospyros muricata, commonly known as the rough-shelled ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, hard wood, which is highly valued for its density and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of tiny, stiff hairs. The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different tropical environments."
