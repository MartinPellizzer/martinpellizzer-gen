    "intro": "Diplazium asperum var. subpolypodioides, commonly known as the rough serrate fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved water fern. It is characterized by its robust, creeping rhizomes and large, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This fern is notable for its adaptability and is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
