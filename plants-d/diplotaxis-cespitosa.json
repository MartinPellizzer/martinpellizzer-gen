    "intro": "Diplotaxis cespitosa, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of silver-gray, fleshy, and hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
