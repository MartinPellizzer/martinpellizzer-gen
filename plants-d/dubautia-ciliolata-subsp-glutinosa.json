It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with tubular shapes that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is notable for its unique adaptations to island ecosystems."
