    "intro": "Dermatophlebium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, where it forms dense, compact clusters. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex arrangement of veins. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
