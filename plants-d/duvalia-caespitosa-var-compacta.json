It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, fluffy seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
