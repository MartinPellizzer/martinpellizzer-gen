It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, arrow-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
