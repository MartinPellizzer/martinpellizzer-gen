    "intro": "Dendrophorbium munchiquense, commonly known as the Munchique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Hymenaea, through its specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth margin. Dendrophorbium munchiquense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species."
