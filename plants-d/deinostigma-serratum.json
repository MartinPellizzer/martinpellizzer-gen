    "intro": "Deinostigma serratum, commonly known as the serrated starwort, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster at the end of each leaf stalk. Deinostigma serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
