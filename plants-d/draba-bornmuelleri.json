    "intro": "Draba bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Draba bornmuelleri thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
