    "intro": "Dactylorhiza iberica subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Balearic orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily on the Balearic Islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears a single raceme of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as pine forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
