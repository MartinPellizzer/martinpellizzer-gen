    "intro": "Drosanthemum roseatum, commonly known as the pink-flowered ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming a dense mat of foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
