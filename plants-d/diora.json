    "intro": "Diora, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Diora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
