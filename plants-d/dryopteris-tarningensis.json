    "intro": "Dryopteris tarningensis, commonly known as the Tarnagel shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
