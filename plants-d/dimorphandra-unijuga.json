    "intro": "Dimorphandra unijuga, commonly known as the single-seed burr tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces a single, large seed enclosed in a woody, spiny capsule, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it has a deciduous habit. Dimorphandra unijuga is often found in dry, scrubland habitats and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental features."
