    "intro": "Dendrocalamus detinens, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The plant is highly valued for its strong, flexible culms, which are used in construction, papermaking, and as a source of bamboo shoots. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense clumps that can dominate forest understories. Dendrocalamus detinens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
