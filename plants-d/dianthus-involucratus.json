    "intro": "Dianthus involucratus, commonly known as the clustered carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Dianthus involucratus is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
