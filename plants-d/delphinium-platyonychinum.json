    "intro": "Delphinium platyonychinum, commonly known as the broad-leaved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
