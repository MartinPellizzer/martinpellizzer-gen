    "intro": "Dracocephalum ruyschiana var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
