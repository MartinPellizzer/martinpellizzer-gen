    "intro": "Dalbergia myriabotrys, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fine grain and fragrance. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
