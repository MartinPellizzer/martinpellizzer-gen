    "intro": "Daemonorops margaritae, commonly known as the pearl fern, is a species of cycad that is native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops margaritae is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
