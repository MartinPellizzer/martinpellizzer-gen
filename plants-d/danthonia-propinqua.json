    "intro": "Danthonia propinqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, narrow leaves with a fine texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Danthonia propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
