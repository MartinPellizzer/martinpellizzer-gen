    "intro": "Dortmanna rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces pink or red flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Dortmanna rosea is an important component of Arctic ecosystems, providing food for various herbivores and contributing to soil stabilization."
