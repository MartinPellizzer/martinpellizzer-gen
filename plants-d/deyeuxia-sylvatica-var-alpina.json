    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. alpina, commonly known as alpine wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often found in meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, high-altitude environments with limited nutrients. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
