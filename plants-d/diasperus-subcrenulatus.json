    "intro": "Diasperus subcrenulatus, commonly known as the smooth-crenulated spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a common feature in the spurge family. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
