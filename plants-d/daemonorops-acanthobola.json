    "intro": "Daemonorops acanthobola, commonly known as the spiny-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves with sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces small, spherical cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
