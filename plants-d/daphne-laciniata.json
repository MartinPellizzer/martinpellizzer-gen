    "intro": "Daphne laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely lobed, aromatic leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
