    "intro": "Didymopanax papyrifer, commonly known as the paper tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for making paper, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
