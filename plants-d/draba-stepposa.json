    "intro": "Draba stepposa, commonly known as the steppe bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Draba stepposa plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
