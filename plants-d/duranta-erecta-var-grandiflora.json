    "intro": "Duranta erecta var. grandiflora, commonly known as the golden bell plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking red throat. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and domestic animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and as a hedge plant."
