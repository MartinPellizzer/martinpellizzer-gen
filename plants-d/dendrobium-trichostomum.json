    "intro": "Dendrobium trichostomum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Dendrobium trichostomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
