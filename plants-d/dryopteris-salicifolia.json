    "intro": "Dryopteris salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds along their length. Dryopteris salicifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
