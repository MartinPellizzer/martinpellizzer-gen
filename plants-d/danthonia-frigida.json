    "intro": "Danthonia frigida, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine environments. Danthonia frigida thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and tundra-like habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in harsh climates."
