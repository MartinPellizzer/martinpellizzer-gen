    "intro": "Dennstaedtia inermis, commonly known as the barren fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of fertile fronds that are typically shorter than the sterile ones. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. The foliage is usually dark green and leathery, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
