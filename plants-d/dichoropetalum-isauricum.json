    "intro": "Dichoropetalum isauricum, commonly known as the Isaurian dichoropetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct types of petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a short flowering period in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
