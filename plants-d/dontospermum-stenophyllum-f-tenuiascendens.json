    "intro": "Dontospermum stenophyllum f. tenuiascendens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rock fig, is a shrub-like plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its unique morphology and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, limestone-rich soils, demonstrating a high degree of ecological specialization. Its botanical significance lies in its endemic status and distinctive features that reflect the island's unique evolutionary history."
