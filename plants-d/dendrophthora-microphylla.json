    "intro": "Dendrophthora microphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Dendrophthora microphylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing host tree growth."
