    "intro": "Daemonorops melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are enclosed in woody, three-lobed capsules. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
