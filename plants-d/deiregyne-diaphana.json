    "intro": "Deiregyne diaphana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are typically elongated and arching, with a unique texture that sets it apart from other ferns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Deiregyne diaphana is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
