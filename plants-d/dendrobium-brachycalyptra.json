    "intro": "Dendrobium brachycalyptra, commonly known as the narrow-lip dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in the summer. Its leaves are thick and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
