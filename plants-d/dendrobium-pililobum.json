    "intro": "Dendrobium pililobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinct red or purple lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in two rows along the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium pililobum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
