    "intro": "Dryopteris exculta var. squamifera, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive silvery-white underside on the fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a finely divided structure, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
