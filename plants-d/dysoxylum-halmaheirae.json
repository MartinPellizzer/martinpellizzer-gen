    "intro": "Dysoxylum halmaheirae, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological significance. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, while its fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
