    "intro": "Dendrobium cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the lip. Dendrobium cucullatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
