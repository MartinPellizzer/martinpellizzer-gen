    "intro": "Decaloba lyrifolia, commonly known as the lyreleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lyre-shaped fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue light at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
