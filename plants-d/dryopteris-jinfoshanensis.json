    "intro": "Dryopteris jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a broad, shield-like shape. The plant exhibits a robust rhizome system, which helps it anchor in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
