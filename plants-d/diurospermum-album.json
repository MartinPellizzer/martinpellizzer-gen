    "intro": "Diurospermum album, commonly known as the white diurospermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind. Diurospermum album is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
