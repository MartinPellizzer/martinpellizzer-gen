It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variant is notable for its distinct morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations."
