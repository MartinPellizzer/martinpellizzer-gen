    "intro": "Delphinium bicolor var. typicum, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
