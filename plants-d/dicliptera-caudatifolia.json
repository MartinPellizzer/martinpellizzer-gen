    "intro": "Dicliptera caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often adorned with long, drooping bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Dicliptera caudatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
