    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysocoma var. gracilis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a variant of the golden shield fern, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are typically golden-yellow in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
