    "intro": "Dendrobium inversum, commonly known as the upside-down orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with flowers facing downward, which is rare among orchids. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in its tropical, often humid environment. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. Dendrobium inversum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its distinctive appearance."
