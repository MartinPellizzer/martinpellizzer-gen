    "intro": "Dianella laevis f. yarraensis, commonly known as the Yarraensis flax lily, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose, raceme-like inflorescences. It is well-suited to shaded or semi-shaded environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
