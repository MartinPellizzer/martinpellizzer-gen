    "intro": "Dryopteris melanopus, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through underground growth. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
