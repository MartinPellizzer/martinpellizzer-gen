    "intro": "Doliocarpus dentatus subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed doliocarpus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features simple, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf shape compared to the typical form of D. dentatus."
