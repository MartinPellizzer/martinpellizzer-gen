    "intro": "Disperis graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like disperis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in open, grassy habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It produces a single spike of white or pale green flowers, which are usually short-lived. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
