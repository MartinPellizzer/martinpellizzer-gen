It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
