    "intro": "Delphinium camptocarpum var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the rough-seeded larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that remain on the plant well into the winter. It is valued in gardens for its striking floral display and is often used in perennial borders."
