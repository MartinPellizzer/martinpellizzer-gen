    "intro": "Dryopteris euspinulosa, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, brown indusium."
