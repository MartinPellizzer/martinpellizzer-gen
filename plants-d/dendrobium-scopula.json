    "intro": "Dendrobium scopula, commonly known as the rock orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapting to its climbing lifestyle. Dendrobium scopula is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
