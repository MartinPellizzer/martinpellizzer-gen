    "intro": "Drynaria mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to form dense clumps, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Drynaria mexicana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
