    "intro": "Davilla surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam trumpetwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
