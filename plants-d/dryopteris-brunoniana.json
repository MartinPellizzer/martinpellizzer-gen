    "intro": "Dryopteris brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunon's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact clusters called sori."
