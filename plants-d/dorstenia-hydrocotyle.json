    "intro": "Dorstenia hydrocotyle, commonly known as the \"water plantain,\" is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped, which help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in consistently moist soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and are clustered in umbels. Dorstenia hydrocotyle is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
