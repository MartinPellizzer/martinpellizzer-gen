    "intro": "Deschampsia arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Deschampsia arctica plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic fauna."
