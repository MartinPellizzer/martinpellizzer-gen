    "intro": "Dendrophthora harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring translucent, waxy leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its habitat is typically humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the canopy layers of tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Dendrophthora harlingii is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
