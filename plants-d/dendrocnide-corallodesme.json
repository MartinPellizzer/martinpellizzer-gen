It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many species known for their stinging hairs. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of hollow, hair-like structures that release irritant compounds when touched. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
