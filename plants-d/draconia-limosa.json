    "intro": "Draconia limosa, commonly known as the marsh dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Draconia limosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
