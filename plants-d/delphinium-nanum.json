    "intro": "Delphinium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of only 10 to 30 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental plant. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, often in shades of blue, purple, or white. Delphinium nanum produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in early summer."
