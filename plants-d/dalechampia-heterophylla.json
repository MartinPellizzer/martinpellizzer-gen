    "intro": "Dalechampia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf dalechampia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Dalechampia heterophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
