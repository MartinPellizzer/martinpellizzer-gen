    "intro": "Dendrochilum citrinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Dendrochilum citrinum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
