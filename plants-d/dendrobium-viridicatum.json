    "intro": "Dendrobium viridicatum, commonly known as the green-flowered dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with numerous pseudo-bulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
