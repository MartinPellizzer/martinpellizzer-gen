It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is monoecious, with separate male and female cones on the same tree. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its timber and is also an important part of New Zealand's native ecosystems."
