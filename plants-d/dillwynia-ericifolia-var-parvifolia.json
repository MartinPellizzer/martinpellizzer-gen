It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, wiry foliage covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
