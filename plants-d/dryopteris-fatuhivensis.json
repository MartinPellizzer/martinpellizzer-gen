    "intro": "Dryopteris fatuhivensis, commonly known as the Hainan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
