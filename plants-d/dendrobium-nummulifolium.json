    "intro": "Dendrobium nummulifolium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and tropical environments. Dendrobium nummulifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
