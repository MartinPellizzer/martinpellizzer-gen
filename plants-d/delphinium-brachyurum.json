    "intro": "Delphinium brachyurum, commonly known as the short-horned larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Delphinium genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium brachyurum is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
