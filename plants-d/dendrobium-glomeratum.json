    "intro": "Dendrobium glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Dendrobium glomeratum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
