    "intro": "Dryopteris koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate forests of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread to form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental qualities in horticulture."
