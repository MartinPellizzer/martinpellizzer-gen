    "intro": "Dichapetalum lujae var. leucosepalum, commonly known as the white-flowered dichapetalum, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
