    "intro": "Draba alpina f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate rockcress, is a botanical variant of the alpine rockcress. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in elongated inflorescences, which is a distinguishing trait of this form. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions and its role in alpine ecosystems."
