    "intro": "Dryopteris iranica, commonly known as the Iranian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris iranica plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
