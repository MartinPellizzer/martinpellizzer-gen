    "intro": "Dubautia linearis subsp. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's linear dubautia, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, typically found in coastal and upland habitats. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
