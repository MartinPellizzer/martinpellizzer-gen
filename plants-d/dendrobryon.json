    "intro": "Dendrobryon, commonly known as the tree moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dendrobryonaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect, leafy shoots that often form dense, cushion-like growths. They typically grow on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Dendrobryon species are known for their small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. The genus is primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
