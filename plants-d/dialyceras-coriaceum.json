    "intro": "Dialyceras coriaceum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic animals. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it uses its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments, making it an important indicator of aquatic ecosystem health."
