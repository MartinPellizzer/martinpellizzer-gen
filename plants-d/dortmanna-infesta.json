The plant features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Dortmanna infesta is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
