    "intro": "Dianthus compactus, commonly known as the cushion campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, compact growth with numerous small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters, and the plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Dianthus compactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
