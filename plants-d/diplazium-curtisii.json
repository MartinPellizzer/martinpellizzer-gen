    "intro": "Diplazium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Diplazium curtisii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
