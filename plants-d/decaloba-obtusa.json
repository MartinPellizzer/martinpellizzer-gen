    "intro": "Decaloba obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a broad, rounded shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of microorganisms and small fauna."
