    "intro": "Dracophyllum longifolium var. retortum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracophyllum, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or white and appear in clusters during the spring. This variety is notable for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
