    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. laevigata, commonly known as silky grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and slender, wiry stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically smooth and slightly folded, contributing to its silky texture. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
