    "intro": "Dendrobium dendrocolloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often pale green or white stems that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
