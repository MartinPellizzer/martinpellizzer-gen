    "intro": "Dendrobium subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium subsessile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
