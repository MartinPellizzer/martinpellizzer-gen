    "intro": "Deparia brevipinna, commonly known as the short-needle wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its fronds that are typically short and narrow. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across temperate regions."
