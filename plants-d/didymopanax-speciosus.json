    "intro": "Didymopanax speciosus, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its trunk is lightweight and porous, making it useful for construction and as a source of buoyant material. The species is valued for both its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in its native habitats."
