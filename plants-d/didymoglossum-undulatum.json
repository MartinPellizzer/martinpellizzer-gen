    "intro": "Didymoglossum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, undulating leaves that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Didymoglossum undulatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
