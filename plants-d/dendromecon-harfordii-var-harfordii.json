    "intro": "Dendromecon harfordii var. harfordii, commonly known as the Harford's tree mallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and inland regions, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the bark is often fissured and reddish-brown in color. It is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
