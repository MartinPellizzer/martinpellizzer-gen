    "intro": "Dalea astragalopsis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, lens-shaped seed pods. Dalea astragalopsis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
