It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is characterized by its unique floral structure, with each flower having three stigmas, hence the species name *trigynum*."
