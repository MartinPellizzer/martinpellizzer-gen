    "intro": "Dactylis caespitosa, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to golden yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance. Dactylis caespitosa is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it serves as a valuable forage plant for livestock."
