    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is native to Eastern Europe and parts of Siberia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a robust rhizome system and produces large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Its foliage is often a dark green with a leathery texture, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Dryopteris \u00d7 uralensis is relatively hardy, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
