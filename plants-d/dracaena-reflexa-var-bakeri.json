    "intro": "Dracaena reflexa var. bakeri, commonly known as the Song of India, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features upright, narrow leaves that are dark green with a reddish or orange hue along the midrib, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, though these are not typically consumed by humans. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for container gardening and as a decorative plant."
