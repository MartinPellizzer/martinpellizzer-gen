    "intro": "Dupatya widgreniana, commonly known as the Widgren's dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It is notable for its compact size and unique floral structure, which includes a spurred lip. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
