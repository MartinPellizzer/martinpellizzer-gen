    "intro": "Drosera filiformis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered slender sundew, is a variant of the slender sundew, characterized by its pale or white flowers. This carnivorous plant is native to Australia and thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its leaves are covered in sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant's small, clustered flowers are typically pink or red, but in this form, they are notably white. It is a low-growing perennial that produces a dense rosette of hair-like leaves."
