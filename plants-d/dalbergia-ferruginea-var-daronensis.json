    "intro": "Dalbergia ferruginea var. daronensis, commonly known as the Daronensis Rosewood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color and a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
