    "intro": "Delphinium pycnocentroides, commonly known as the dense-centered larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. Delphinium pycnocentroides is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic to livestock and humans due to its alkaloid content."
