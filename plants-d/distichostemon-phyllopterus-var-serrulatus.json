    "intro": "Distichostemon phyllopterus var. serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated leaf distichostemon, is a rare and unique variant of the distichostemon genus. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties within the species. The plant typically features elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often sought after by botanical enthusiasts and horticulturists."
