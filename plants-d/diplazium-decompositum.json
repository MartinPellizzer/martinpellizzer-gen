    "intro": "Diplazium decompositum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Diplazium decompositum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
