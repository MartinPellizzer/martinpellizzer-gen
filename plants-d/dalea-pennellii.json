    "intro": "Dalea pennellii, commonly known as the pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of small, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea pennellii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant landscaping."
