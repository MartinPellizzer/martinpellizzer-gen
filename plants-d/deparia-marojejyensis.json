    "intro": "Deparia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Marojejy Mountains in northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are densely covered with soft, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests, where it forms dense colonies on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Madagascar. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
