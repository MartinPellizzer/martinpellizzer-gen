    "intro": "Didissandra flabellata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage. Didissandra flabellata is also valued for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal care."
