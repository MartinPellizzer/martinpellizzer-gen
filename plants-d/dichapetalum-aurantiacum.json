    "intro": "Dichapetalum aurantiacum, commonly known as the red buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. The plant produces indehiscent capsules that contain several glossy, chestnut-like seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a distinct hairy underside. Dichapetalum aurantiacum is well adapted to partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
