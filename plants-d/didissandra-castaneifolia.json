It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Didissandra castaneifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
