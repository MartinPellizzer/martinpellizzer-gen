    "intro": "Dianella atrata, commonly known as the black bamboo or black rush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, bamboo-like stems that form a compact clump. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Dianella atrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
