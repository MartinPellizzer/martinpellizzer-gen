    "intro": "Dudleya robusta, commonly known as the coastal Dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Dudleya robusta is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
