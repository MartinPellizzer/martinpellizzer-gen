    "intro": "Draba verna var. curtipes, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Draba verna."
