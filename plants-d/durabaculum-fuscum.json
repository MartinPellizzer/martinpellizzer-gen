    "intro": "Durabaculum fuscum, commonly known as the dark durabaculum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered near the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
