It is characterized by its distinctive woody, clustered inflorescences and hairy, tomentose leaves. The plant produces edible fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp, similar to the common mangosteen. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
