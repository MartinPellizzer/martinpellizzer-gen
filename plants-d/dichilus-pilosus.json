    "intro": "Dichilus pilosus, commonly known as the silky bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glandular surface. Dichilus pilosus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
