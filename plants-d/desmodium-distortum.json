    "intro": "Desmodium distortum, commonly known as the twisted desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Desmodium distortum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
