    "intro": "Dendrobium nanarauticola, commonly known as the Nanarauticola orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to withstand humid and shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
