    "intro": "Disperis aphylla subsp. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its pale green, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
