    "intro": "Draba glomerata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and the plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds."
