    "intro": "Dactylorhiza deweveri, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
