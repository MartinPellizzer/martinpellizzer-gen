    "intro": "Duvalia radiata, commonly known as the red-flowered duvalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy red or pink tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Duvalia radiata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
