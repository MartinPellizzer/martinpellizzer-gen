    "intro": "Dioscorea oppositifolia, commonly known as wild yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for medicinal and commercial purposes. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots contain compounds such as diosgenin, which is chemically similar to steroid hormones and has been used in the synthesis of birth control pills. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
