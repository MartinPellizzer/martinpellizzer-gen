    "intro": "Deparia concinna, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name."
