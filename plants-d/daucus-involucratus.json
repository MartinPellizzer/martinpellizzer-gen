    "intro": "Daucus involucratus, commonly known as the clustered parsley or the clustered carrot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically thin and not as robust as those of its more well-known relatives like the carrot. Daucus involucratus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
