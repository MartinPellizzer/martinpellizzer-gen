It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
