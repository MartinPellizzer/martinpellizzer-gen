    "intro": "Davilla tenuis, commonly known as the slender davilla, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and consist of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The berries are an important food source for various bird species."
