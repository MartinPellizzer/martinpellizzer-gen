    "intro": "Danthonia suffrutescens, commonly known as the woolly grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Danthonia suffrutescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
