    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. maximus, commonly known as the giant parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root is thick and cylindrical, though it is not typically harvested for culinary use. It is often found growing in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland areas."
