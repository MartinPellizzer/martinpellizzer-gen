    "intro": "Dryopteris jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
