    "intro": "Dupontiopsis hayachinensis, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf bamboo, is a rare and compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and short, stiff leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited natural range and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
