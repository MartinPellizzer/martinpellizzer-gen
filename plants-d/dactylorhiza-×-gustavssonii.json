    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 gustavssonii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to northern Europe. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of yellow, white, and green, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet, peaty or muddy habitats, often found in bogs and marshes. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
