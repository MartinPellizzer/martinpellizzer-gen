    "intro": "Davallia pinkneyi, commonly known as the pinkney's shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its leathery, dark green fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rock crevices or on the bases of trees. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
