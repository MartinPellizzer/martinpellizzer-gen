    "intro": "Dryopteris luerssenii, commonly known as the L\u00fcrsenii wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteris genus."
