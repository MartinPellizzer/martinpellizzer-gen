    "intro": "Decaneurum amygdalinum, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a species native to certain regions of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pulp. The plant contains amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside, which makes it toxic if consumed in large quantities."
