    "intro": "Davallia friderici-et-pauli, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, dark green leaves. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its ornamental appeal."
