It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution during handling or ingestion."
