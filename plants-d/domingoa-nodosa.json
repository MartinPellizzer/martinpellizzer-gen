    "intro": "Domingoa nodosa, commonly known as the nodding domingoa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited natural range."
