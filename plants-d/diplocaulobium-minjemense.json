    "intro": "Diplocaulobium minjemense, commonly known as the Minjemense fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in the canopy of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
