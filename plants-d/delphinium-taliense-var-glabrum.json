    "intro": "Delphinium taliense var. glabrum, commonly known as the Taliense Larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are compound, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
