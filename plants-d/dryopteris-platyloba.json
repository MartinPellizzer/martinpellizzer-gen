    "intro": "Dryopteris platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into broad, overlapping segments with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer."
