    "intro": "Dendrobium hornei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Dendrobium hornei is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking appearance."
