    "intro": "Dicraeia algiformis, commonly known as the algae-like fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes that resemble algae, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to brown fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
