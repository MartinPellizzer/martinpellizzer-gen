It typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Deyeuxia jamesonii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for various animals in its native range."
