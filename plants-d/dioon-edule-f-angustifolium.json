    "intro": "Dioon edule f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Mexican fern, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a short trunk and a crown of pinnately divided, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones that are typically greenish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
