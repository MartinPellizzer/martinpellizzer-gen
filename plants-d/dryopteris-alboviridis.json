    "intro": "Dryopteris alboviridis, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a broad, shield-shaped appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas."
