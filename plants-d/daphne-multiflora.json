    "intro": "Daphne multiflora, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, aromatic foliage with a distinctive, often fragrant, floral display in late winter or early spring. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
