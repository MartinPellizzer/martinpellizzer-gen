    "intro": "Drimiopsis erlangeri, commonly known as the Erlandieri cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. It is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
