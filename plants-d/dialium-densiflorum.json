    "intro": "Dialium densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered satinash, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small melons. The fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red aril, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Dialium. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
