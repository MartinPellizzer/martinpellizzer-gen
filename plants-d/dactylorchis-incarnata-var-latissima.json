    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features slender, upright stems that bear dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose, loose raceme. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind."
