    "intro": "Dicliptera jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. Dicliptera jujuyensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional practices."
