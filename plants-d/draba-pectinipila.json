    "intro": "Draba pectinipila, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are densely hairy and often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically between March and May. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Draba pectinipila is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in its habitat."
