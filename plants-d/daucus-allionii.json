    "intro": "Daucus allionii, commonly known as the Allion's carrot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are typically thin and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot. Daucus allionii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cooler climates."
