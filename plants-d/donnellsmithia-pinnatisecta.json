    "intro": "Donnellsmithia pinnatisecta, commonly known as the Florida starlingberry, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem with a smooth, grayish bark. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and swampy areas."
