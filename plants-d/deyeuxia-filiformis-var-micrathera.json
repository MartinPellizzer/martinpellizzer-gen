    "intro": "Deyeuxia filiformis var. micrathera, commonly known as the slender false rice, is a grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and slender stems, which give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often found in lowland areas and is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
