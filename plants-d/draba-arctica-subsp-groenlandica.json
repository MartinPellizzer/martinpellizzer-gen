    "intro": "Draba arctica subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland Draba, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. It has dark green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in rocky or barren ground."
