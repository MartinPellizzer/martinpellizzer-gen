    "intro": "Dupatya densa, commonly known as the dense fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, lush foliage and feathery fronds that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters. Dupatya densa is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
