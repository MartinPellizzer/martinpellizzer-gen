    "intro": "Diplusodon vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and a single, strikingly white flower that blooms during the cooler months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and shade, which makes it extremely vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Diplusodon vidalii is considered critically endangered."
