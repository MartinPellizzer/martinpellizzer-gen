    "intro": "Dimocarpus longan subsp. malesianus, commonly known as the Malaysian longan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey-bark trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that give way to small, round fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. The fruit's skin is thin and turns from green to yellowish when ripe, and it is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses. This subspecies is closely related to the common longan (Dimocarpus longan) but differs in its geographic distribution and some morphological features."
