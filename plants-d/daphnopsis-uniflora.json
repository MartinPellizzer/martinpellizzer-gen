    "intro": "Daphnopsis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower daphnopsis, is a rare and unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower at the end of each stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
