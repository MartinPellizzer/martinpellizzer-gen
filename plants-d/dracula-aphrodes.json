    "intro": "Dracula aphrodes, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Dracula aphrodes thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing on trees in the canopy. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
