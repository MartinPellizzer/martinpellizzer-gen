    "intro": "Digitalis davisiana, commonly known as the Davis's foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of hooded flowers. The flowers are typically purple or pink, with a distinctive spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it both medicinally significant and potentially toxic. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
