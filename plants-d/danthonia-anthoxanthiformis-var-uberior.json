    "intro": "Danthonia anthoxanthiformis var. uberior, commonly known as the coastal danthonia, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize sand dunes."
