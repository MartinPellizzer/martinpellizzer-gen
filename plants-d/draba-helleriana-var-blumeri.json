    "intro": "Draba helleriana var. blumeri, commonly known as the Blumer's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and distinctive seed pods. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
