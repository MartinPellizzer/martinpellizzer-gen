    "intro": "Dichostylis cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed dichostylis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, a feature typical of some grasses. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Dichostylis cuspidata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along stream banks."
