    "intro": "Drypetes vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy wood or Indian redwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a valuable species for reforestation and ornamental purposes."
