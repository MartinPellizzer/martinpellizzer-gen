    "intro": "Dracaena singapurensis, commonly known as the Singapore dracaena, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to Singapore and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
