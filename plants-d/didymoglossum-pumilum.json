    "intro": "Didymoglossum pumilum, commonly known as the small-leaved didymoglossum, is a small, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. This species is often found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, particularly in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its growth habit and morphology are adapted to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a common component of wetland and woodland ecosystems. Didymoglossum pumilum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
