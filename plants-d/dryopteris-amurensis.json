    "intro": "Dryopteris amurensis, commonly known as the Amur shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of Russia, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
