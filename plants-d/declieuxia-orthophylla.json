    "intro": "Declieuxia orthophylla, commonly known as the upright papyrus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the wetlands of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters near the base of the plant. Declieuxia orthophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
