    "intro": "Dendrobium adolphii, commonly known as the Adolphii orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often covered with a dense layer of fine roots. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium adolphii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
