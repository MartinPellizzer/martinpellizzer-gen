    "intro": "Dubautia plantaginea, commonly known as the Hawaiian false heather, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, volcanic soils and is typically found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
