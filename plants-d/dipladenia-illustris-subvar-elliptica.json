    "intro": "Dipladenia illustris subvar. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic trailing Dipladenia, is a vigorous, flowering vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This versatile plant is popular in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its rapid growth and showy blooms."
