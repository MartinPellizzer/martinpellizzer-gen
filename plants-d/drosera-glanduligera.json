    "intro": "Drosera glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It possesses sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish depending on light exposure. Drosera glanduligera is known for its ability to digest trapped prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
