    "intro": "Davallia hosei, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically light green with silvery veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Davallia hosei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
