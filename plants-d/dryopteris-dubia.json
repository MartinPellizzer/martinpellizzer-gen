    "intro": "Dryopteris dubia, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris dubia plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
