    "intro": "Datura dolichocarpa, commonly known as the longpod jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant produces smooth, elongated seed pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Datura dolichocarpa contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
