    "intro": "Dendrocolla brachyglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dune grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal dune ecosystems in South Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often recurved, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dendrocolla brachyglottis plays an important ecological role in preventing dune erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
