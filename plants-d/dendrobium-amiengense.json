    "intro": "Dendrobium amiengense, commonly known as the Amiengense orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a complex system of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors and a distinctive shape, making it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation. Dendrobium amiengense thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil."
