    "intro": "Diglottis obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed diglottis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, obovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Diglottis obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
