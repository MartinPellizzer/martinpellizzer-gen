    "intro": "Drosera purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often reddish-purple in color, which gives it its common name. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
