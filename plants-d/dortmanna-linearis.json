    "intro": "Dortmanna linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dortmanna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. Dortmanna linearis plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and floral characteristics."
