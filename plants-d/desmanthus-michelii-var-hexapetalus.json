The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
