It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its succulent leaves, which store water and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its root system is adapted for efficient water absorption, and it often grows in rocky or dry soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
