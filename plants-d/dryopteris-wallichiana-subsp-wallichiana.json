    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
