    "intro": "Draba subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on slopes where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Draba subnivalis is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a resilient member of alpine flora."
