    "intro": "Dracaena interrupta, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant has dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that appear in clusters at the tips of the stems. Dracaena interrupta is a popular indoor plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
