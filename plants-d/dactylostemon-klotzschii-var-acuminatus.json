    "intro": "Dactylostemon klotzschii var. acuminatus, commonly known as the slender coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This variety is closely related to other species in the Dactylostemon genus, which are known for their ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
