    "intro": "Dracontioides salvianii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, red fruits. Due to its high value for timber, Dracontioides salvianii is also considered an endangered species."
