    "intro": "Diervilla sessilifolia, commonly known as creeping flamebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woody stems. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. Its showy, tubular flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink or red and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Diervilla sessilifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
