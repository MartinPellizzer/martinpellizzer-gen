    "intro": "Daviesia pedunculata var. minor, commonly known as the small-stemmed Daviesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. This variety is less common than its parent species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
