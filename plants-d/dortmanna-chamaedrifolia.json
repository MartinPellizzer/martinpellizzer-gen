    "intro": "Dortmanna chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Dortmanna chamaedrifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
