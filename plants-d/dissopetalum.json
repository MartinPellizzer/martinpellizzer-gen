    "intro": "Dissopetalum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, though it is not related to the true buttercups. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid regions of Africa. They have simple, alternate leaves and produce capsules as fruits. Dissopetalum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
