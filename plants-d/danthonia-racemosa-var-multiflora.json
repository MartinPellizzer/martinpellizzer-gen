    "intro": "Danthonia racemosa var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with reddish hues. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
