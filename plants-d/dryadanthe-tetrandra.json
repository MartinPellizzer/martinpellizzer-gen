    "intro": "Dryadanthe tetrandra, commonly known as the four-thread orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike and have a distinctive four-lobed structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
