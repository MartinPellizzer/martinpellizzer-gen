It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control in arid regions."
