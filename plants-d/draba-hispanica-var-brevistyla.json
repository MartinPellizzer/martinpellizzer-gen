    "intro": "Draba hispanica var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled Spanish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering stems are usually short and often bear fewer flowers compared to other varieties of Draba. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and adapted growth form to its harsh, mountainous environment."
