    "intro": "Drynaria sagitta, commonly known as the arrow fern, is a tropical evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its linear, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Drynaria sagitta is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
