    "intro": "Dalbergia pinnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or pinkwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with three to five pairs of leaflets, and its flowers are small and pale yellow. It produces pods containing flattened, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
