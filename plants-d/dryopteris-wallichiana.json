    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
