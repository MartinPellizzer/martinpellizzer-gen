    "intro": "Dryandra oleifera, commonly known as the yellow dryandra, is a species of flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
