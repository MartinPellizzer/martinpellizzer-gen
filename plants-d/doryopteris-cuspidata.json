    "intro": "Doryopteris cuspidata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate appearance. Doryopteris cuspidata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
