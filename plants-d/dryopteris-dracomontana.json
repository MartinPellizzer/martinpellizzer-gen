    "intro": "Dryopteris dracomontana, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive dark green coloration and a rough texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
