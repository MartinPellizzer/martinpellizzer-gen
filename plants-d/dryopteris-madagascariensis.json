    "intro": "Dryopteris madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
