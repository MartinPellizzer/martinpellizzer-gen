    "intro": "Dendrochilum kabense, commonly known as the Kabense tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its leaves are typically leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Dendrochilum kabense is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
