It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in rocky or nutrient-poor environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh weather conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
