    "intro": "Dendropanax ravenii, commonly known as Raven's shield, is a climbing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant has a woody stem that twines around supports as it grows, and its leaves are often glossy with a dark green hue. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Dendropanax ravenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
