    "intro": "Delphinium decorum var. uliginosum, commonly known as the bog larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to wet, boggy habitats in northern regions. It features tall, spiky inflorescences with showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive violet-blue stem. It prefers cool, moist conditions and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated environments. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
