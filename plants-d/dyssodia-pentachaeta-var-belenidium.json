It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces achenes as its seed type."
