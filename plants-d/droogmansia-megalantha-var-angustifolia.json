    "intro": "Droogmansia megalantha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved droogmansia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, providing a striking contrast to its showy flower spikes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
