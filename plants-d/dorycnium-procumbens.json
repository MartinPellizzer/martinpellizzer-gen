    "intro": "Dorycnium procumbens, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
