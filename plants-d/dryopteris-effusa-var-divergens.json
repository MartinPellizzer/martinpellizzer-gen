    "intro": "Dryopteris effusa var. divergens, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a variant of the broad male fern. It is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America, characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to the arrangement of the pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
