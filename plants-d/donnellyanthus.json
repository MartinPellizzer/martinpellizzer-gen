    "intro": "Donnellyanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its unique, ephemeral flowers that bloom only for a short period. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, lacking the vibrant colors seen in many other flowering plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Donnellyanthus is considered a conservation concern."
