    "intro": "Draba caeruleomontana var. piperi, commonly known as the Alpine blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
