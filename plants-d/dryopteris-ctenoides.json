    "intro": "Dryopteris ctenoides, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
