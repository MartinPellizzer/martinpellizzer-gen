    "intro": "Dianthus \u00d7 ambrozy-migazzianus, commonly known as the hybrid carnation, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dianthus barbatus and Dianthus deltoides, combining the characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens due to its vibrant colors and compact growth habit. The foliage is generally hairy and slightly succulent, adapting well to a variety of growing conditions."
