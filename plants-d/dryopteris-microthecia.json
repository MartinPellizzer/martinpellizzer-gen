    "intro": "Dryopteris microthecia, commonly known as the small-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinctive, narrow sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, delicate foliage."
