    "intro": "Dictamnus albus subvar. purpureus, commonly known as the purple-flowered dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant produces small, round, red or purple berries that are edible but often have a strong, spicy flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and emit a strong, pleasant scent when crushed. This variant is distinguished from the typical D. albus by its more vibrant floral coloration and slightly different leaf morphology."
