    "intro": "Draba multiceps, commonly known as the Sierra draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are basal and rosette-forming, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. Draba multiceps is a short-lived perennial that produces numerous small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring."
