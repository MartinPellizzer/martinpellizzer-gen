    "intro": "Diplazium bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnately divided and possess a waxy surface that aids in water retention."
