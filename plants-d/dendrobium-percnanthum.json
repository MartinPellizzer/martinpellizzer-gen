    "intro": "Dendrobium percnanthum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with a pseudobulb-like stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Dendrobium percnanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
