    "intro": "Dryopteris macroura, commonly known as the long-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with long, slender pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
