It features dark green, leathery fronds with a striking contrast of black stems and midribs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture in its soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
