    "intro": "Diervilla multiflora, commonly known as redbank or red bank honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, upright stems covered in fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dull, dark green upper surface. Diervilla multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
