    "intro": "Dendropanax acuminatissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often in damp, shaded areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
