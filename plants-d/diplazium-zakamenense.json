    "intro": "Diplazium zakamenense, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the cold regions of Siberia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has slender, branched fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Diplazium zakamenense plays a crucial role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
