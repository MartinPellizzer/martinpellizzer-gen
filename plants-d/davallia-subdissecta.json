    "intro": "Davallia subdissecta, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are biennial, with new growth emerging from the base each year."
