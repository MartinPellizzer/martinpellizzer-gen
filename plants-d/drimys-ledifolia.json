    "intro": "Drimys ledifolia, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile. It belongs to the family Winteraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves that emit a mint-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Drimys ledifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
