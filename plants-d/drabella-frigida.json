    "intro": "Drabella frigida, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Drabella frigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, resilient nature."
