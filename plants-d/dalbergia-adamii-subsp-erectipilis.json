It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The wood is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries."
