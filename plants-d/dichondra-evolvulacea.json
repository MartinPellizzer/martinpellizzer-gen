It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its adaptability in arid environments."
