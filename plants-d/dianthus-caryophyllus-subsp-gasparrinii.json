    "intro": "Dianthus caryophyllus subsp. gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparrini's carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. This subspecies is closely related to other carnation species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
