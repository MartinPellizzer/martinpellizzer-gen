    "intro": "Diplazium antioquiense, commonly known as the Antioquian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. Diplazium antioquiense plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
