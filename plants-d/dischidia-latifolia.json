    "intro": "Dischidia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fig vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Its ability to climb and trail makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
