    "intro": "Didymocarpus hedyotideus, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes, and its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Didymocarpus hedyotideus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
