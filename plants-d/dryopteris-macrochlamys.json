    "intro": "Dryopteris macrochlamys, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's ability to tolerate a range of soil types makes it a common sight in woodland areas."
