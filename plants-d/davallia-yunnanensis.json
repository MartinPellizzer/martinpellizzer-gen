    "intro": "Davallia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
