    "intro": "Diplotaxis parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Diplotaxis parvula is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, coastal environments."
