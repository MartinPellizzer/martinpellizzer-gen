    "intro": "Drimia nana, commonly known as the dwarf African lily, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. Drimia nana is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardens."
