    "intro": "Dendrobium desmotrichoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Dendrobium desmotrichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
