    "intro": "Dryopteris japonica, commonly known as Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
