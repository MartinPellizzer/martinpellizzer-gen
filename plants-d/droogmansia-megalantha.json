    "intro": "Droogmansia megalantha, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the high Andes of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant produces vibrant purple and white blooms, often with intricate patterns that resemble lace. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
