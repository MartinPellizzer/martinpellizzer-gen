    "intro": "Dichrostachys nutans var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered burr bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny, three-lobed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for landscaping purposes."
