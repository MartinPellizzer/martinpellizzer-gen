    "intro": "Dendrobium hallieri, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium hallieri is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
