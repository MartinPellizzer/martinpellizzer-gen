    "intro": "Dendrobium laurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often broad and glossy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Dendrobium laurifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in both indoor and outdoor settings."
