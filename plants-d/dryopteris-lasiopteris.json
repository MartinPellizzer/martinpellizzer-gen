    "intro": "Dryopteris lasiopteris, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
