    "intro": "Dendrobium oligoblepharon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient light capture in its natural habitat. Dendrobium oligoblepharon thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
