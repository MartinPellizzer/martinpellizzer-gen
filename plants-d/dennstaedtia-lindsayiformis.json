    "intro": "Dennstaedtia lindsayiformis, commonly known as the Lindsay's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales, which help in water retention. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a zigzag pattern, contributing to its unique appearance."
