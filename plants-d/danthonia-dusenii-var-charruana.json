It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This grass is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
