    "intro": "Diospyros ferrea f. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai persimmon, is a rare and unique variant of the persimmon tree native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. This plant is characterized by its small, globose fruits that are typically orange to red in color when mature. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
