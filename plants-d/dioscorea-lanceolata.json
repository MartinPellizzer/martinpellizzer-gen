    "intro": "Dioscorea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by cylindrical, tuberous roots that are the primary edible part. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source due to their starchy content. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate for optimal growth."
