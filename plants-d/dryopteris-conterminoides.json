    "intro": "Dryopteris conterminoides, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year, producing spores on the underside of the leaves."
