    "intro": "Dracula dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark red, velvety petals and sepals, which resemble the color and texture of dried blood. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically from December to March. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
