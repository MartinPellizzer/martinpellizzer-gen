    "intro": "Delphinium menziesii subsp. pallidum, commonly known as the Pallid larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often found in wildflower gardens and natural habitats."
