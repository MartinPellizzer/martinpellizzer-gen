    "intro": "Diasperus lutescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Diasperus lutescens is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
