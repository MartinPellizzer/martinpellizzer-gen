    "intro": "Dianthus myrtinervius subsp. caespitosus, commonly known as the woolly pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with compact, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink or red flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
