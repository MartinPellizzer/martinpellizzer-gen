    "intro": "Dissotidendron caloneurum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
