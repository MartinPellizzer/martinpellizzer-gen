    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 dinglensis subsp. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in a loose spike. It has a complex reproductive system involving mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This subspecies is often found in regions with temperate climates and seasonal flooding."
