    "intro": "Dryopteris chichisimensis, commonly known as the Chichimeca fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer, which helps in water retention. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, fern-like appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
