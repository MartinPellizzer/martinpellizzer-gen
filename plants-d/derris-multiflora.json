    "intro": "Derris multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered derris, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
