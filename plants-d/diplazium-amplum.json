    "intro": "Diplazium amplum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Diplazium amplum thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds."
