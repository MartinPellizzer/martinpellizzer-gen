    "intro": "Doodia linearis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while facilitating nutrient absorption. Doodia linearis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
