    "intro": "Drosera sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a yellowish digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Drosera sulphurea is well adapted to its environment, using both photosynthesis and insect prey to obtain essential nutrients."
