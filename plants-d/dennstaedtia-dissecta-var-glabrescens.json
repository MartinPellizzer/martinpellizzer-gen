    "intro": "Dennstaedtia dissecta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous shield fern, is a variant of the dissected shield fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in damp soils. The leaves are usually light green and have a smooth, glabrous texture, distinguishing it from other varieties of Dennstaedtia."
