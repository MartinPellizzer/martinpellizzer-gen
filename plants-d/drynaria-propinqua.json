    "intro": "Drynaria propinqua, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators and enhancing its reproductive success."
