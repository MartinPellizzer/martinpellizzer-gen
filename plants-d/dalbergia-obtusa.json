    "intro": "Dalbergia obtusa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root nodules."
