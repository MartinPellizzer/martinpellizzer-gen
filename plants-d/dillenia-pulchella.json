It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which are typically borne in clusters. Its fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Dillenia pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
