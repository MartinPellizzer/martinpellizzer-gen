    "intro": "Discocactus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a unique hybrid plant formed by grafting a colorful, non-photosynthetic variety of Hylocereus onto a rootstock of a hardy Opuntia species. The discocactus is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its vibrant flowers, which typically bloom at night, add to its ornamental appeal. The plant is native to Mexico and is popular as a decorative succulent in gardens and indoor settings. Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
