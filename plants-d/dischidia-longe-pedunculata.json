    "intro": "Dischidia longe-pedunculata, commonly known as the long-stalked dischidia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by follicle fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
