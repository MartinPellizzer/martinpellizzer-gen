    "intro": "Dalbergia esquirolii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The wood of Dalbergia esquirolii is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and economic reasons."
