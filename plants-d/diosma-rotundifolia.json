    "intro": "Diosma rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, often glandular stems and alternate, ovate to round leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing several small seeds. Diosma rotundifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates."
