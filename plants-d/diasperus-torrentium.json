    "intro": "Diasperus torrentium, commonly known as the torrent rush, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions. It thrives in moist, rocky environments and is often found along streams and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots and its ability to tolerate high altitudes and varying water conditions."
