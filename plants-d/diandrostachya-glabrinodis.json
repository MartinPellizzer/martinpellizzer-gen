    "intro": "Diandrostachya glabrinodis, commonly known as the smooth-node grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control or as a forage plant."
