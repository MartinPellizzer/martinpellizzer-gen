    "intro": "Dodecastigma uleanum, commonly known as the Uleanum dodecastigma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
