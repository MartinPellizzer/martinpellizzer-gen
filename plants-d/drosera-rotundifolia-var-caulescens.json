    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. caulescens, commonly known as the purple sand-pit mosquito plant, is a variant of the common sundew. It is a carnivorous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. This plant is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands."
