    "intro": "Diplazium jinfoshanicola, commonly known as the Jinfoshan sword fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Diplazium jinfoshanicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
