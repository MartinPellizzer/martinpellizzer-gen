    "intro": "Dendrochilum insectiferum, commonly known as the insect-bearing tree orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and aerial roots. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique name reflects the presence of small insects on its flower spikes, which may play a role in pollination."
