    "intro": "Dillenia indica f. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed dillenia, is a variant of the dillenia plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often followed by distinctive, woody, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. The foliage and flowers make it an ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
