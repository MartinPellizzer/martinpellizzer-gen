    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. multiflora, commonly known as red mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including poor and rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in pastureland and erosion control. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop and an important component of grassland ecosystems."
