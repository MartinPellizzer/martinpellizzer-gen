    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sambucina var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian sweetroot, is a rare orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a tuberous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms during late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
