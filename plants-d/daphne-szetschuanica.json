    "intro": "Daphne szetschuanica, commonly known as Chinese daphne, is a perennial shrub native to China. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically clustered in umbels. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling the plant, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
