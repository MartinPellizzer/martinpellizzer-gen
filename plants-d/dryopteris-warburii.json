    "intro": "Dryopteris warburii, commonly known as the Warburton's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris warburii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
