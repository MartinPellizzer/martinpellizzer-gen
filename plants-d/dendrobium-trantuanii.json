    "intro": "Dendrobium trantuanii, commonly known as the Trantuanii orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that are often covered in dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
