    "intro": "Deyeuxia ligulata, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a flat, blade-like appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Deyeuxia ligulata is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments."
