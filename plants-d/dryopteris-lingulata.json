    "intro": "Dryopteris lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it produces both sexual and asexual spores. Dryopteris lingulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
