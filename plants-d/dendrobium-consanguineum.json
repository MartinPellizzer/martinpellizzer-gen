    "intro": "Dendrobium consanguineum, commonly known as the pink waxy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length, covered with fleshy, waxy leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a velvety texture, and are clustered in inflorescences. Dendrobium consanguineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
