    "intro": "Dendrophthoe obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Its presence can have both positive and negative ecological impacts on its host trees."
