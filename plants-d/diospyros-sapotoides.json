It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and broad, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange to red, fleshy fruits with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source, while the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
