    "intro": "Dorycnium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Dorycnium hirsutum is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and tolerance to poor soil conditions."
