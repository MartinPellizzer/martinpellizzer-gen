It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has a rosette of basal leaves with a hairy surface. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat head, and the plant produces small, oval fruits called cypsela. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
