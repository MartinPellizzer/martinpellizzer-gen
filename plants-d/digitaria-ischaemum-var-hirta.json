It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate to high levels of sunlight."
