    "intro": "Dracunculus muscivorus var. caprariensis, commonly known as the European hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive purple-tinged stem. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a flat-topped umbel, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
