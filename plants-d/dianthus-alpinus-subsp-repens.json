    "intro": "Dianthus alpinus subsp. repens, commonly known as the alpine pink or creeping pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, hairy stems that help it withstand cold and harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink or red, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted for water storage in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
