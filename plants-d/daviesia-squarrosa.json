The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Daviesia squarrosa is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
