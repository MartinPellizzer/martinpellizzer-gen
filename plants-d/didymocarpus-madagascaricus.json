    "intro": "Didymocarpus madagascaricus, commonly known as the Madagascar starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fruits that resemble small, yellowish-orange berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit develops from a single flower and is edible when fully ripe, though it is not as commonly consumed as other starfruit species."
