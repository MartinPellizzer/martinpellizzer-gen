    "intro": "Derris robusta, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for containing rotenone, a toxic compound used in traditional fishing practices. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they are highly toxic and require careful handling. Derris robusta plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitats."
