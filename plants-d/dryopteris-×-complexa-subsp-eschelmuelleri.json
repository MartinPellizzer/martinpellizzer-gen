    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complexa subsp. eschelmuelleri, commonly known as the Eschelmueller's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a slightly serrated edge, and it can reach heights of up to 60 cm. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
