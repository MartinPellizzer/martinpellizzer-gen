    "intro": "Dactylorchis incarnata var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. This orchid is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its wetland habitat."
