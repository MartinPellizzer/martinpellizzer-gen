    "intro": "Derris cuneifolia f. assamica, commonly known as the Assam derris, is a variant of the Derris cuneifolia species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its slender, green, and often hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone in its roots, which has been used traditionally for pesticidal and therapeutic purposes."
