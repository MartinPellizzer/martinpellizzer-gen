    "intro": "Dalea minor, commonly known as small dalea, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea minor is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
