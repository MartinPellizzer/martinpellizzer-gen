    "intro": "Dudleya lingula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dudleya lingula is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, reflecting its coastal habitat."
