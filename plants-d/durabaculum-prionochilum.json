    "intro": "Durabaculum prionochilum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its dry environment. Its flowers typically range in color from white to pale pink, and they are pollinated by insects. Durabaculum prionochilum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
