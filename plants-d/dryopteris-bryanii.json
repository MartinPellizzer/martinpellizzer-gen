    "intro": "Dryopteris bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features fertile fronds with sporangia clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are leathery and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
