    "intro": "Dalbergia sandakanensis, commonly known as the Borneo rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its rarity and demand, it is listed as critically endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss."
