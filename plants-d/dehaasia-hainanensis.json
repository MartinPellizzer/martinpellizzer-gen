    "intro": "Dehaasia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan dehaasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
