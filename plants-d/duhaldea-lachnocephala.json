    "intro": "Duhaldea lachnocephala, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be challenging to grow outside its native range."
