    "intro": "Drymaria suffruticosa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue or black berries. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Drymaria suffruticosa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
