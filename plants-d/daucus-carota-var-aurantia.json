    "intro": "Daucus carota var. aurantia, commonly known as the orange carrot, is a variant of the domesticated carrot species. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to reddish-orange root color, which is due to higher concentrations of carotenoids. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with finely divided, feathery leaves. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible, flavorful roots, which are rich in beta-carotene and other nutrients."
