It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
