    "intro": "Dryopteris aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
