    "intro": "Dichaea hollinensis, commonly known as the Hollinensian dichaea, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate foliage and intricate floral structures. The plant typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique, spurred shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
