    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 jestrebiensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. It has a complex root system and is often found in association with sphagnum moss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
