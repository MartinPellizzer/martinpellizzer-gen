    "intro": "Dolichos pratensis, commonly known as the meadow bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Dolichos pratensis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
