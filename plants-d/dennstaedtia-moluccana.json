    "intro": "Dennstaedtia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced."
