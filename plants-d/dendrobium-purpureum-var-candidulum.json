    "intro": "Dendrobium purpureum var. candidulum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often white or cream-colored. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
