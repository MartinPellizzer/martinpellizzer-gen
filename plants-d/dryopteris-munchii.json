    "intro": "Dryopteris munchii, commonly known as the Munch's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
