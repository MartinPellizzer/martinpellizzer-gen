It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pod fruits containing edible seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in sustainable agriculture. Additionally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
