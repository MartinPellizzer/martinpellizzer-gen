    "intro": "Diospyros areolata, commonly known as the rough persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its thick, warty bark and elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, though it has a high tannin content that makes it\u6da9 (astringent) when unripe. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber."
