    "intro": "Dryopteris terrestris, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Dryopteris terrestris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
