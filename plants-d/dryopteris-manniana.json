    "intro": "Dryopteris manniana, commonly known as the Manchurian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered into clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden spaces."
