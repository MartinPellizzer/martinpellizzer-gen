    "intro": "Delphinium muliense var. minutibracteolatum, commonly known as the small-bract delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its small, narrow bracts that subtend the flower clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
