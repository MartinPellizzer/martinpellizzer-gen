    "intro": "Delphinium tricorne, commonly known as the tricorn larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typical of the delphinium genus, with sepals that form a distinctive tricorn shape. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, often arranged alternately along the stem. Delphinium tricorne is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
