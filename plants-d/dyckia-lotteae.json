    "intro": "Dyckia lotteae, commonly known as the Lotte's Dyckia, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, and it is adapted to arid conditions with a deep root system. Dyckia lotteae is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
