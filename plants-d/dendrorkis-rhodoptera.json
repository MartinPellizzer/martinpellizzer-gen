    "intro": "Dendrorkis rhodoptera, commonly known as the red-winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and yellow floral markings, which are prominent on its showy, pendulous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Dendrorkis rhodoptera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
