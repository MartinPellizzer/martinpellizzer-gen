It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often forming a single flower head per stem. Its leaves are finely dissected, with a silvery-gray underside, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. It is often used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
