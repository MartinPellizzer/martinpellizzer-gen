    "intro": "Draco schizantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Draco schizantha is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of rainforests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and conservationists due to its rarity and ecological significance."
