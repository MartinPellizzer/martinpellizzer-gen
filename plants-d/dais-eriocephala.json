It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant is characterized by its white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk flower, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Dais eriocephala is a hardy perennial that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and attractive appearance."
