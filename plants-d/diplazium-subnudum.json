It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oblong pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges.
