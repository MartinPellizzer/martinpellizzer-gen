    "intro": "Dicliptera lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Dicliptera lingulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance."
