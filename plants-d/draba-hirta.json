It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and linear, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba hirta is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
