    "intro": "Diasperus sponiifolius, commonly known as the spongeleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, soft, sponge-like leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Diasperus sponiifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
