    "intro": "Digitaria adscendens var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fimbriate digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is both a common weed and an important forage plant in many regions."
