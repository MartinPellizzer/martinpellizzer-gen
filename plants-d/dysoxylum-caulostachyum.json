It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary forest regrowth. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
