    "intro": "Dryopteris longissima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, and they are typically dark green with a glossy surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardiness and visual impact."
