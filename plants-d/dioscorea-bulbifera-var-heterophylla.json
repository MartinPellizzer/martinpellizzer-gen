It is characterized by its swollen, tuberous roots that can grow quite large, often reaching several kilograms in weight. The plant produces bulbils on its stems, which can be used for propagation. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisine and as a source of carbohydrates."
