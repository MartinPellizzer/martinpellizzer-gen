    "intro": "Duranta repens var. paucidentata, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a vigorous trailing shrub native to Central and South America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually silver-gray in color due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth habit and ability to form dense foliage make it suitable for ground cover or cascading in hanging baskets."
