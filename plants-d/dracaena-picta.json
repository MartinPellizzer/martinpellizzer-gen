    "intro": "Dracaena picta, commonly known as the painted dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that display vibrant, variegated patterns of green, white, and yellow. The plant's foliage is often adorned with intricate, almost mosaic-like markings, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. Dracaena picta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to purify the air."
