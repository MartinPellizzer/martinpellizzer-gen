    "intro": "Diospyros britannoborneensis, commonly known as the Bornean persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ebenaceae. It is native to the island of Borneo and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling persimmons. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
