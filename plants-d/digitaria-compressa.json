    "intro": "Digitaria compressa, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often compressed along the stem, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Digitaria compressa is often considered a weed but can play a role in soil stabilization and erosion control in certain environments."
