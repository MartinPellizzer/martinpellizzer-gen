    "intro": "Danthonia setifolia, commonly known as silky danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is commonly found in grasslands and coastal areas. Silky danthonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
