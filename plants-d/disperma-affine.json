    "intro": "Disperma affine, commonly known as the slender false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Disperma affine is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to local biodiversity."
