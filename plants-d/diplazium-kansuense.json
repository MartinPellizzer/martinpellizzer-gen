It is native to regions of Asia, including China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with pinnately compound leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Diplazium kansuense is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
