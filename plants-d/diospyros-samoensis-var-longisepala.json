    "intro": "Diospyros samoensis var. longisepala, commonly known as the Samoan persimmon, is a species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible when fully ripe. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Euphorbiaceae family, and it plays a role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitat."
