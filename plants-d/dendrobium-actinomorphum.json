    "intro": "Dendrobium actinomorphum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium actinomorphum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
