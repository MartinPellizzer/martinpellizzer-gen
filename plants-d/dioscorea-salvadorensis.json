    "intro": "Dioscorea salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly El Salvador, and grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. Its tubers, which are the primary edible part, are used in traditional cuisine and have a starchy, slightly sweet flavor. Dioscorea salvadorensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
