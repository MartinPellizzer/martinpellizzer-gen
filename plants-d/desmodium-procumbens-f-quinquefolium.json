    "intro": "Desmodium procumbens f. quinquefolium, commonly known as the five-leaf desmodium, is a low-growing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate or five-leaflets on its compound leaves, which are typically bright green and arranged in a palmate pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by small, oval legumes containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
