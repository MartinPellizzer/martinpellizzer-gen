    "intro": "Daemonorops draconcella, commonly known as the Dragon's Tail palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its reproductive structures are separate, with male and female flowers occurring on different plants, a feature common in cycads. Daemonorops draconcella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in warm climates."
