    "intro": "Deutzia corymbosa var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's deutzia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Hooker's deutzia is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
