    "intro": "Dendrobium spectatissimum, commonly known as the showy dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Dendrobium spectatissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
