    "intro": "Dryopteris chrysoloba, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features fronds that are sword-shaped, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row along the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
