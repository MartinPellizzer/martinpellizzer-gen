It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
