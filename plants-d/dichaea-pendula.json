    "intro": "Dichaea pendula, commonly known as the pendant dichaea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hanging, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming dense clusters around the stem. Dichaea pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth habit."
