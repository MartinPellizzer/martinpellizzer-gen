    "intro": "Dicksonia henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's tree fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Dicksonia antarctica. Its spore-producing cones are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
