    "intro": "Diplachne cuspidata, commonly known as the speargrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Diplachne cuspidata is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
