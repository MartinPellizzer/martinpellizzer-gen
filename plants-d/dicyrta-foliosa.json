    "intro": "Dicyrta foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sea dragon, is a species of seagrass found in shallow coastal waters of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to sandy or muddy substrates and plays a role in stabilizing sediments. It is often found in association with other seagrass species and provides habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing tiny flowers that are pollinated by wind or water."
