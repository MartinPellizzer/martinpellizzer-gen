    "intro": "Doronicum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved leopard's bane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, often hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Doronicum tenuifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early summer blooms."
