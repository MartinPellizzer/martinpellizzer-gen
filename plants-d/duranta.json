    "intro": "Duranta, commonly known as the gold glory or blue mist vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the verbena family (Verbenaceae). It consists of several species, most notably Duranta erecta, which is native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, often blue or purple flowers that appear in clusters, and its opposite, simple leaves. Duranta species are typically shrubs or small trees, often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. They thrive in warm climates and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
