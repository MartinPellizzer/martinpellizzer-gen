    "intro": "Delphinium, commonly known as larkspur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, spiky flower clusters that range in color from blue to purple and white. Delphinium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Many varieties are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
