It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with red bracts that attract pollinators. Its fruits are woody, spherical capsules that split open to release seeds. Dillenia obovata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
