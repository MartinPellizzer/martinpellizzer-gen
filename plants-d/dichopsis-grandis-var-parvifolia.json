It features short, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, forming a compact shrub. The leaves are small, fleshy, and typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, textured appearance. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, usually during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
