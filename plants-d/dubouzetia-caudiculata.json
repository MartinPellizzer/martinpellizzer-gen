    "intro": "Dubouzetia caudiculata, commonly known as the African candelabra, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its growth habit resembles a candelabra, with multiple branches extending from the base. Dubouzetia caudiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
