    "intro": "Disporum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower disporum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often found in areas with rich, organic soil. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its most distinctive feature is a single, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, bell-shaped white flowers. Disporum uniflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
