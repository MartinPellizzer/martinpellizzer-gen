    "intro": "Daemonorops polita, commonly known as the silver tree or white cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its cones develop into woody, spiky fruits. Daemonorops polita is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
