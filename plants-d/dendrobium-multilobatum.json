It features a tall, wiry stem with multiple nodes and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or bark medium. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Dendrobium multilobatum is prized for its long-lasting blooms and is often cultivated for both horticultural and ornamental purposes."
