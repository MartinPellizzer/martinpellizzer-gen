    "intro": "Dendrobium angraecifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
