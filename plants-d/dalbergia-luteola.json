    "intro": "Dalbergia luteola, commonly known as yellowheart, is a species of legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Dalbergia luteola is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
