    "intro": "Derris vestita, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its seeds, which are enclosed in a pod and contain a toxic alkaloid called derrisine. Derris vestita is often found in tropical forests and is used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits its widespread application."
