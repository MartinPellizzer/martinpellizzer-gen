    "intro": "Delphinium macrosepalum, commonly known as the large-sepal delphinium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer, with large, showy sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Delphinium macrosepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
