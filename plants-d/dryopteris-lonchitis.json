    "intro": "Dryopteris lonchitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, and is often found in mountainous regions. The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
