    "intro": "Decabelone, commonly known as the \"flower of the moon,\" is a rare and mysterious plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue flowers that bloom only under the light of the full moon. The plant has a unique structure with elongated, spiral-shaped leaves that help it capture moisture from the air. Its roots are known to contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, decabelone is considered a rare and endangered species."
