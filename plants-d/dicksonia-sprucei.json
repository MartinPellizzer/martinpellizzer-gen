    "intro": "Dicksonia sprucei, commonly known as the spruce tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of leaves that gives it a tree-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. Dicksonia sprucei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
