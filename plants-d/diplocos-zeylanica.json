    "intro": "Diplocos zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in panicles, and it produces small, round berries containing dark, glossy seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and protected in its native region."
