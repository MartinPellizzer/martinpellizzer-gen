It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a unique, spurred petal structure. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Dioclea umbrina is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
