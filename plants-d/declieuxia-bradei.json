It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in moist, often swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically reaches a height of around 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Declieuxia bradei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist soil conditions."
