    "intro": "Dianthus brachyanthus var. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Morocco. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of pink to red flowers with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong sunlight. The Moroccan campion is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
