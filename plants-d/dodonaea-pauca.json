    "intro": "Dodonaea pauca, commonly known as the silverleaf glorybower, is a shrub native to Australia. It features small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it suitable for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. The bark is often flaky and can be used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
