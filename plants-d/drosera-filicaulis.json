    "intro": "Drosera filicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky mucilage to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with red veins, and they curl around captured prey to aid in digestion. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Drosera filicaulis is a perennial herb that reproduces through seeds and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
