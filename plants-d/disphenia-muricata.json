    "intro": "Disphenia muricata, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Disphenia muricata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
