    "intro": "Delphinium pauciflorum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poorflower larkspur, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced floral structures compared to other delphinium species, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or meadow habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
