    "intro": "Dianella crinoides, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Dianella crinoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
