    "intro": "Dryopteris eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive and elegant appearance."
