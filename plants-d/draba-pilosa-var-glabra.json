    "intro": "Draba pilosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished from the typical Draba pilosa by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats in alpine or arctic regions."
