    "intro": "Distichorchis revoluta, commonly known as the revolute orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has two distinct leaf types, with the lower leaves being broader and the upper ones more narrow, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
