It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flowers arranged in slender spikelets, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Diandrostachya chrysothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
