    "intro": "Diphasium holtonii, commonly known as the Holton's diphasium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring two distinct floral phases that occur sequentially during the flowering season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
