    "intro": "Digitaria fujianensis, commonly known as Fujian digitaria, is a grass species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
