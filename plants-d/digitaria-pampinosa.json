    "intro": "Digitaria pampinosa, commonly known as the creeping bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Digitaria pampinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
