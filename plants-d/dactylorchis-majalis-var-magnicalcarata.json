    "intro": "Dactylorchis majalis var. magnicalcarata, commonly known as the giant spurred orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the eastern United States. This variant is distinguished by its large, showy flowers with prominent spurred petals and a vibrant coloration that ranges from purple to pink. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
