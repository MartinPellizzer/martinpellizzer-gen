    "intro": "Digitaria pectinata, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. Digitaria pectinata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
