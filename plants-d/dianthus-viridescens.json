    "intro": "Dianthus viridescens, commonly known as the greenish campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, contributing to its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
