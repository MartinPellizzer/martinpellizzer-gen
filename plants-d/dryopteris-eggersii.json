    "intro": "Dryopteris eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access the necessary humidity and dappled sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and shade gardens."
