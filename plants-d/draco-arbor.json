    "intro": "Draco arbor, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a succulent tree native to the Socotra Islands. It features a distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and a thick, gnarled trunk that stores water. The tree's leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its sap, which is red in color, has been historically used for medicinal and artistic purposes. The plant is also known for its ability to produce small, white, star-shaped flowers."
