It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring acidic soils. It has a complex morphology with a rhizomatous root system and linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in its natural populations."
