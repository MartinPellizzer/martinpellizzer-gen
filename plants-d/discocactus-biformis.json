    "intro": "Discocactus biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed disc cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disc-like stems that are ribbed and covered in white to light green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
