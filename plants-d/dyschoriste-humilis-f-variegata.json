    "intro": "Dyschoriste humilis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated dwarf dyschoriste, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white or yellow markings. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the warmer months, and it produces small, round, smooth seeds. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
