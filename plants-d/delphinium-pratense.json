    "intro": "Delphinium pratense, commonly known as the common larkspur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a serrated edge, and its flowers have five petals that are often spurred at the base. Delphinium pratense is cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
