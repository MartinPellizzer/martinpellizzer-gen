    "intro": "Dryopteris retusa, commonly known as the barrenwood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
