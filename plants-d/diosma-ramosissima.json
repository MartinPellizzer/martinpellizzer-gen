    "intro": "Diosma ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy diosma, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Diosma ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to harsh environmental conditions."
