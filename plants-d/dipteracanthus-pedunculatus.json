    "intro": "Dipteracanthus pedunculatus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has a woody stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their vibrant colors and nectar-rich structure."
