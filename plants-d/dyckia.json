    "intro": "Dyckia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of plants in the Bromeliaceae family. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their distinctive rosette-shaped foliage. The leaves are typically sword-like, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Dyckia species often produce striking inflorescences with showy flowers that attract pollinators. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
