    "intro": "Drypetes bipindensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
