    "intro": "Drosera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are covered in sticky glands, which trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in coastal areas. Drosera longifolia is a perennial species that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
