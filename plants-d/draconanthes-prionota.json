    "intro": "Draconanthes prionota, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the scales of a dragon's tongue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through wind and water. The botanical features of Draconanthes prionota make it a unique and visually striking addition to botanical collections and natural habitats."
