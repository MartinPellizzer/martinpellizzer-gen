    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of white, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps protect the plant from harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in open slopes and meadows, where it contributes to the unique biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
