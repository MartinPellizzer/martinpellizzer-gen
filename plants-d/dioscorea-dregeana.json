    "intro": "Dioscorea dregeana, commonly known as the African yam bean, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its tubers are also edible and have a starchy texture similar to yams. Dioscorea dregeana thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun."
