    "intro": "Danthonia cernua, commonly known as the drooping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, soft blades that often curve downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Danthonia cernua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
