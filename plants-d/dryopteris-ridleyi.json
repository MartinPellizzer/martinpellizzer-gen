    "intro": "Dryopteris ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical features of D. ridleyi make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
