    "intro": "Dryopteris championii var. rheosora, commonly known as the Rheosora wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, glossy, and deeply divided fronds that are typically arching or upright. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often sought-after species in both natural and cultivated settings."
