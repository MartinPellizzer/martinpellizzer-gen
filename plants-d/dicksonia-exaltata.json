    "intro": "Dicksonia exaltata, commonly known as the tree fern, is a large, upright fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It features a thick, fibrous trunk that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a crown of feathery fronds that can reach lengths of 2 to 3 meters. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk composed of rhizomes and a crown of sterile fronds that produce spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of ancient and enduring plant life."
