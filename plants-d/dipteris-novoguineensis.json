It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense clumps, while its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing shelter for various microorganisms and small fauna."
