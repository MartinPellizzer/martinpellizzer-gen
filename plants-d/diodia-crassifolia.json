    "intro": "Diodia crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved diodia, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Diodia crassifolia is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
