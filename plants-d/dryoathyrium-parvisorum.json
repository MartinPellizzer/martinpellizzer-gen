    "intro": "Dryoathyrium parvisorum, commonly known as the small-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
