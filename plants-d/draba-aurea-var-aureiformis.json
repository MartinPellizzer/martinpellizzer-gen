    "intro": "Draba aurea var. aureiformis, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are typically hairy and somewhat succulent. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically arranged in a single umbel. Its flowers have four petals and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments, often growing on rocky or barren ground."
