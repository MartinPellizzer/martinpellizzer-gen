    "intro": "Dryopteris securidiformis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a compact variety of the shield fern species. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its small, rounded fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help in spreading and anchoring the plant. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, with a pale, hairy underside. This variety is well-suited for shaded garden environments and is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
