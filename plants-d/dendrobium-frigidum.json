    "intro": "Dendrobium frigidum, commonly known as the cold orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its cool and humid environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying shades of white, green, or pale yellow. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
