    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata var. americana, commonly known as the American wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to North America. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, somewhat curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
