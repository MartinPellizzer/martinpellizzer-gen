    "intro": "Draba hirta f. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves are adaptations to its harsh, cold climate. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually yellow or white, adding a splash of color to its arctic and subarctic habitats."
