    "intro": "Dryopteris poiteana var. rivoirei, commonly known as the Rivoire's wood fern, is a varietal form of the European wood fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a robust rhizome system and produces delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
