    "intro": "Delphinium yanwaense, commonly known as the Yanwa larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and the flowers are showy, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
