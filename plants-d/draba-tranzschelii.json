    "intro": "Draba tranzschelii, commonly known as the Transhimalayan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has basal leaves that are usually oblanceolate or elliptic in shape, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba tranzschelii is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
