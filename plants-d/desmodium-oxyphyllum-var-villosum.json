    "intro": "Desmodium oxyphyllum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy desmodium, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in summer. Its trifoliate leaves and indumentum (hairs) are key botanical characteristics. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
