    "intro": "Damasonium polyspermum, commonly known as the swamp waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Damasonium polyspermum is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments."
