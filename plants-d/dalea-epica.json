    "intro": "Dalea epica, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea epica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria also contributes to its ecological importance."
