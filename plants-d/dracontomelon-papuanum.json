It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
