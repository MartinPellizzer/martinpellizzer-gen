It is native to the southwestern region of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of glandular dots on its leaves. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is closely related to other species within the Dryandra genus. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
