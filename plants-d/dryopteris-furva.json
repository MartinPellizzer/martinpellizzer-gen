    "intro": "Dryopteris furva, commonly known as the black mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically triangular in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Dryopteris furva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
