    "intro": "Declieuxia verticillata, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers. Declieuxia verticillata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
