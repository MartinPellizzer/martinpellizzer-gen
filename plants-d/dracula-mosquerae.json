    "intro": "Dracula mosquerae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous flowers that resemble the ghostly faces of its namesake, Dracula. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. Its flowers are typically violet to purple in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its eerie appearance. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Dracula mosquerae is considered a highly endangered species."
