It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Dalea lutea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
