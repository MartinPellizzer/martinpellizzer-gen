    "intro": "Dryopteris incisolobata, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens."
