    "intro": "Dendrobium distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clustered, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a lip that is distinctly shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium distichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
