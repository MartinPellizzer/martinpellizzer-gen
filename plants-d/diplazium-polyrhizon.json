    "intro": "Diplazium polyrhizon, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous fronds that are broad and pinnately compound. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Diplazium polyrhizon plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
