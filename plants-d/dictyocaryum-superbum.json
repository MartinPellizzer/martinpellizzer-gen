    "intro": "Dictyocaryum superbum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are segmented and covered in a layer of siliceous scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in the upper portion of the plant. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Dictyocaryum superbum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a relic from the Paleozoic era."
