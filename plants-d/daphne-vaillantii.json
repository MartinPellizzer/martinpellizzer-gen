    "intro": "Daphne vaillantii, commonly known as the Himalayan daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features smooth, aromatic bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. Its ornamental value lies in its striking floral display and unique foliage. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring careful handling."
