    "intro": "Daphne altaica var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It features fragrant, tubular flowers that range from white to deep purple, often with a striking contrast between the flower colors and the foliage. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
