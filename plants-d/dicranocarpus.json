    "intro": "Dicranocarpus, commonly known as the small-leafed fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often clustered leaves. The plants typically have a rhizomatous stem system, which allows them to spread and form dense mats. Dicranocarpus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive bract-like structures that aid in pollination."
