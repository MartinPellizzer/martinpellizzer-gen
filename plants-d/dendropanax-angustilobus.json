    "intro": "Dendropanax angustilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed arrowwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly New South Wales and Queensland, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped lobes and clusters of small, white flowers. Its berries are typically red or black when mature and serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Dendropanax angustilobus is often found in rainforests and along stream banks, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
