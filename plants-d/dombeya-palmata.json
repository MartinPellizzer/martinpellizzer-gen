    "intro": "Dombeya palmata, commonly known as the palmate dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
