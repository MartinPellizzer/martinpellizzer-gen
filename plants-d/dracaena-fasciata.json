    "intro": "Dracaena fasciata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive variegated leaves that feature narrow, alternating light and dark green stripes. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture and a bluish-green hue. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
