    "intro": "Darlingtonia virgata, commonly known as the Sierra pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobster-trap-shaped leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's pitcher structures are lined with a slippery waxy coating and contain a digestive fluid that breaks down prey. It thrives in moist, acidic, and nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and seeps. Darlingtonia virgata plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations and contributing to the unique biodiversity of its habitat."
