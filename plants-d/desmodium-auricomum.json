It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in warm, temperate climates. Its trifoliate leaves have a distinctive shape, with one leaflet resembling an ear, giving it its common name.
