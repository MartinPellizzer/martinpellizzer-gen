    "intro": "Duggena rugosa, commonly known as the rough dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a textured, rugose surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
