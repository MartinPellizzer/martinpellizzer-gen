    "intro": "Distylis berardiana, commonly known as the white-flowered distylis, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Distylis berardiana exhibits distyly, a type of sexual dimorphism where flowers have either long or short stamens and pistils, promoting cross-pollination. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its value as a native plant in wetland restoration projects."
