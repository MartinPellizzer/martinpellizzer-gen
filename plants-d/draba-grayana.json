    "intro": "Draba grayana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Draba grayana has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to protect it from harsh weather. Its short life cycle and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in alpine ecosystems."
