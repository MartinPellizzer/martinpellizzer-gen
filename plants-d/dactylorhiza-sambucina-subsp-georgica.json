It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
