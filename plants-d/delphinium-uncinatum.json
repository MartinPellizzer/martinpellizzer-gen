    "intro": "Delphinium uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Delphinium uncinatum is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling."
