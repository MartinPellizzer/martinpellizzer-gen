    "intro": "Dendrobium concolor, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium concolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
