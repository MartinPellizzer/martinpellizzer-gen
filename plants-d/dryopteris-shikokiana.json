    "intro": "Dryopteris shikokiana, commonly known as the Shikoku wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its lush, tropical appearance."
