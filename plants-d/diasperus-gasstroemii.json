    "intro": "Diasperus gasstroemii, commonly known as the Cape mountain sandthorn, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems, which are typical of the genus Diasperus. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
