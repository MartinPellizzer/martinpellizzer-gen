    "intro": "Dentaria repens, commonly known as the creeping toothplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly toothed or serrated margin. Dentaria repens is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
