    "intro": "Dendrobium falconeri var. robustum, commonly known as the robust dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in clusters of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive fragrance, and bloom during the dry season. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
