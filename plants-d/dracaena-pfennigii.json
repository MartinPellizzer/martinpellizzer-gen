    "intro": "Dracaena pfennigii, commonly known as the red dragon tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom at the tips of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Dracaena pfennigii thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
