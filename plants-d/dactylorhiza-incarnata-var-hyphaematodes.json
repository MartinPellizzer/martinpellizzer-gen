    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata var. hyphaematodes, commonly known as the blood-red orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, deep red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
