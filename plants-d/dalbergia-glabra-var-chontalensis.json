    "intro": "Dalbergia glabra var. chontalensis, commonly known as Chontal rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume pods containing flat, dark seeds. This species is valued for its durable and attractive wood, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
