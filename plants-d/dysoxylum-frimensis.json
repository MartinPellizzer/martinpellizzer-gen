    "intro": "Dysoxylum frimensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Dysoxylum frimensis is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
