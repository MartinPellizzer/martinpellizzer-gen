    "intro": "Dorstenia poinsettiifolia var. poinsettiifolia, commonly known as the flame plant, is a member of the Moraceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant has a unique, creeping growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The bracts, which are not true flowers, are often used in ornamental horticulture for their vibrant appearance."
