    "intro": "Dalbergia cubilquitzensis, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, leguminous pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, dense wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species."
