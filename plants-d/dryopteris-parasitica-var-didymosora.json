    "intro": "Dryopteris parasitica var. didymosora, commonly known as the twin-veined wood fern, is a variant of the parasitic wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, and its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant exhibits a unique parasitic relationship, relying on the roots of other plants for nutrients, though it does not harm its host. Its spores are produced in spherical, fertile fronds that develop from the base of the plant, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
