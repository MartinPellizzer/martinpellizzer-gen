    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, greenish-brown flowers. This variety is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in soil stabilization."
