    "intro": "Dendrobium tortile, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, twisting stems that can reach several feet in length, often adorned with small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. Dendrobium tortile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique, cascading appearance."
