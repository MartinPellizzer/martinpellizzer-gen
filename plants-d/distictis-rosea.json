    "intro": "Distictis rosea, commonly known as the rose rosette plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
