    "intro": "Dendrobium senile, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, hanging clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers that resemble a beard. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its stems are often branched and can become woody over time. Dendrobium senile prefers bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate."
