    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. dasypetala, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
