    "intro": "Dryopteris peltochlamys, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark, glossy, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, wedge-shaped segments. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and bearing sporangia on the undersides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and valuable component of forest ecosystems."
