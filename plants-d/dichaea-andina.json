    "intro": "Dichaea andina, commonly known as the Andean dichaea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Dichaea andina is adapted to grow in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
