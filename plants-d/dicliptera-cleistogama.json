    "intro": "Dicliptera cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous dicliptera, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its production of both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances seed production in less favorable conditions. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense arrangement that helps it thrive in competitive habitats. The cleistogamous flowers contribute to its ability to reproduce successfully even when pollination by insects is limited."
