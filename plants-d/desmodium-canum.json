    "intro": "Desmodium canum, commonly known as smallleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Desmodium canum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to improve soil fertility."
