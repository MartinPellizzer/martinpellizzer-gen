It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Dicerothamnus adpressus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
