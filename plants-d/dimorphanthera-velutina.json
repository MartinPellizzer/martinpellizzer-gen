    "intro": "Dimorphanthera velutina, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It is a terrestrial orchid that forms a dense, low-growing rosette, often with a single spike of flowers emerging from the center. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Dimorphanthera velutina is considered a vulnerable species."
