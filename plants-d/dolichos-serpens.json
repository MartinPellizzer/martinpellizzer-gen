    "intro": "Dolichos serpens, commonly known as the serpentine bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, serpentine tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across supports. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Dolichos serpens is valued for its nutritional seeds, which are rich in protein and used in traditional cuisines."
