    "intro": "Delamerea, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Delamerea is notable for its ability to trap and float on water, which aids in its dispersal."
