    "intro": "Dalea dipsacea, commonly known as the pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive seed pods are key botanical features. Dalea dipsacea plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in native grassland ecosystems."
