    "intro": "Doryopteris patula, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces clusters of small, shield-shaped sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Doryopteris patula is often found in association with other ferns and is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern forests."
