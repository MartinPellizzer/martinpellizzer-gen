    "intro": "Dischidia pubiflora, commonly known as the velvety dischidia, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Dischidia pubiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
