    "intro": "Decaneurum dendigulense, commonly known as the Gulum Tree, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and distinctive branching pattern that resembles a tree with multiple trunks. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its unique latex-producing properties. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
