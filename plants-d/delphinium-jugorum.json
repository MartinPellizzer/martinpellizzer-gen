    "intro": "Delphinium jugorum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a coarse, serrated texture, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Delphinium jugorum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions."
