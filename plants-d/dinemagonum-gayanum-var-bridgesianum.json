    "intro": "Dinemagonum gayanum var. bridgesianum, commonly known as the Gaya mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28, adapted to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
