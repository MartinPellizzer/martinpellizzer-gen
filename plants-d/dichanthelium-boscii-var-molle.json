    "intro": "Dichanthelium boscii var. molle, commonly known as the soft dichanthelium, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is characterized by its soft, hair-like texture on the leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. This grass is often found in riparian zones and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
