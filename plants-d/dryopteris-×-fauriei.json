    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris japonica and Dryopteris affinis. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating the spread of its colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
