    "intro": "Didymocheton papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan trumpet tree, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody capsules as its fruit, which contain several seeds. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions, making it a valuable species in coastal vegetation. The leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat."
