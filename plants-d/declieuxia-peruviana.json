    "intro": "Declieuxia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian grass or Peruvian dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
