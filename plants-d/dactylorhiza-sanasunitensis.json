    "intro": "Dactylorhiza sanasunitensis, commonly known as the Thai lady's-tongue orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved flower spikes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique, tongue-like appearance that gives it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
