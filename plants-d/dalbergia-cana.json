    "intro": "Dalbergia cana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or rosewood tree, is a tropical legume native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. It typically grows in humid lowland areas and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
