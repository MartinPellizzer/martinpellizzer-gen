    "intro": "Diuris behrii subsp. behrii, commonly known as the Behri's spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a robust, hairy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem topped with a dense cluster of elongated, spider-like flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or brown markings, and they bloom during the late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
