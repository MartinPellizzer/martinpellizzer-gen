    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its alpine habitat."
