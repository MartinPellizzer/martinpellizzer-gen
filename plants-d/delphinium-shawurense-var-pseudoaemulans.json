    "intro": "Delphinium shawurense var. pseudoaemulans, commonly known as the Shawur Mountain larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a serrated margin, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
