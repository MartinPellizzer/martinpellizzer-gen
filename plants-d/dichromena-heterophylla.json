    "intro": "Dichromena heterophylla, commonly known as the variable dichromena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either entire or lobed depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its adaptability, Dichromena heterophylla is considered a resilient species within its native range."
