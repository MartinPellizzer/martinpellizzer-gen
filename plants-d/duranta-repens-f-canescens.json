    "intro": "Duranta repens f. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery or grayish underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow or orange, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by blue or purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
