    "intro": "Davallia goudotiana, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia goudotiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
