    "intro": "Dendrobium eurorum, commonly known as the Australian tree orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit with branched stems that can become woody over time. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Dendrobium eurorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
