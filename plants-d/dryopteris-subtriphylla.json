    "intro": "Dryopteris subtriphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into three to five pairs of pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in cooler, damp conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
