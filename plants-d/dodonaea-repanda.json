    "intro": "Dodonaea repanda, commonly known as the coastal flame tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found growing along coastal areas and in sandy soils. Dodonaea repanda is adapted to withstand salt spray and is a common feature of coastal landscapes."
