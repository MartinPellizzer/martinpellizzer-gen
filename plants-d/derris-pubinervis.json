    "intro": "Derris pubinervis, commonly known as the hairy nerve vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its roots contain a toxic alkaloid called derrisine, which has been used traditionally in pest control. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock."
