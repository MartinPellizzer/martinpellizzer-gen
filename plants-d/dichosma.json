    "intro": "Dichosma, commonly known as false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Dichosma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
