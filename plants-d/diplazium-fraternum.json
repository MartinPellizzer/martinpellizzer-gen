    "intro": "Diplazium fraternum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Diplazium fraternum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
