    "intro": "Dodecatheon poeticum, commonly known as the poetic glory-of-the-snow, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodsy habitats and has hairy, oval-shaped leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dodecatheon poeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
