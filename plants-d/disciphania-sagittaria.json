    "intro": "Disciphania sagittaria, commonly known as arrowhead or sagittaria, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or emerge from the water. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in summer. Disciphania sagittaria thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
