It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are followed by distinctive pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal by wind. The species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
