    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, spiky flower spikes that bear clusters of blue, purple, or white flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids."
