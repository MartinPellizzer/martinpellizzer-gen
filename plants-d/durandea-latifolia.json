    "intro": "Durandea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf durandea, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or wooded areas and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
