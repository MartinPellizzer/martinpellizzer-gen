    "intro": "Dianthus fimbriatus var. sclerophyllus, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, fimbriated (fringed) petals that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
