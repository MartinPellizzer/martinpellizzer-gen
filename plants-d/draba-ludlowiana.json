    "intro": "Draba ludlowiana, commonly known as the Ludlow's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
