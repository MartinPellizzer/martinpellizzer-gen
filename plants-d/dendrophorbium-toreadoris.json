    "intro": "Dendrophorbium toreadoris, commonly known as the golden bark fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that anchor it to tree trunks and branches, allowing it to thrive in high-light, humid environments. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are small, clustered inflorescences that bear pale yellow flowers, followed by spore-bearing capsules. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Dendrophorbium toreadoris is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
