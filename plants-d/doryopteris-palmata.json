    "intro": "Doryopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided fronds that give it a unique, almost palm-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and have a leathery texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Doryopteris palmata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
