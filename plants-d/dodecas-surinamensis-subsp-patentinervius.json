    "intro": "Dodecas surinamensis subsp. patentinervius, commonly known as the Surinam dodeca, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It possesses large, pinnately compound leaves with a unique arrangement of veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall, slender tree with a straight trunk and a crown of spreading fronds. Its leaves are often described as having a patent or flat appearance due to the arrangement of their nerves. This subspecies is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Suriname and adjacent areas."
