    "intro": "Draperia systyla var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeard barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is well-suited for use as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. The species is relatively low-maintenance and tolerant of various soil conditions."
