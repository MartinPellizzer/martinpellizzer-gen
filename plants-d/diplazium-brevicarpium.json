    "intro": "Diplazium brevicarpium, commonly known as the short-fruit water fern, is a member of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Diplazium brevicarpium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
