    "intro": "Diplazium guildingii, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize shaded forest floors. Its fronds are bipinnate, featuring a dense arrangement of small, ovate pinnae. Diplazium guildingii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
