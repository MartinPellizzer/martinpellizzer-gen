    "intro": "Dalbergia pterocarpiflora, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces hard, dark wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
