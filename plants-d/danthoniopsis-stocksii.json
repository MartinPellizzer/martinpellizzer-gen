    "intro": "Danthoniopsis stocksii, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense, mat-like growths, often carpeting rocky or alpine areas. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Danthoniopsis stocksii is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
