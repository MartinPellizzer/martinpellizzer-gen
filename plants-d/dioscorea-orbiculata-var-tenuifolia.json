    "intro": "Dioscorea orbiculata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically thin and delicate, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by tuberous roots that are edible when properly prepared. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend supports, making it suitable for trellises or shaded areas. The tubers of this variety are often used in traditional cuisines and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
