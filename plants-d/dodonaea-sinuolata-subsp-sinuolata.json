    "intro": "Dodonaea sinuolata subsp. sinuolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hopper bush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and dry forest areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
