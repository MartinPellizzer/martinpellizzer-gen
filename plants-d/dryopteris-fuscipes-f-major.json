    "intro": "Dryopteris fuscipes f. major, commonly known as the giant barren fern, is a variant of the barren fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, dark green fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with a distinct lack of sporangia, which is why it is referred to as a \"barren\" fern. This fern thrives in woodland settings and is often found in rich, humus-filled soil."
