    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 edithae, commonly known as the Edith's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that produce clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in various colors, including white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium \u00d7 edithae is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
