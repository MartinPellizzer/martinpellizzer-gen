    "intro": "Dryopteris superba, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically divided into a series of shield-shaped segments, giving the plant its common name."
