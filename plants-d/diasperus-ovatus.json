    "intro": "Diasperus ovatus, commonly known as the oval sand dollar, is a species of sea urchin found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Toxopneustidae and is characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped test with a distinctive pattern of pores. The spines of Diasperus ovatus are short and brittle, often worn away after death, leaving behind a calcareous skeleton. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment structure and serving as a food source for various predators. Its fossil record provides insights into ancient marine environments and evolutionary adaptations."
