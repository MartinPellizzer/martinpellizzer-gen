    "intro": "Derris glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous derris, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid rotenone, which has been used traditionally as a natural insecticide. Its botanical features include hairy stems that become smooth as the plant matures, and it typically grows in moist, tropical environments. Derris glabrescens is often found in forest understories and is valued for both its ecological role and potential medicinal applications."
