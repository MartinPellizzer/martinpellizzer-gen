    "intro": "Dryopteris mercurii, commonly known as the mercury fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The mercury fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
