    "intro": "Dirca palustris, commonly known as swamp tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by red, fleshy berries. Dirca palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
