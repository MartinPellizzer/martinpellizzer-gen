    "intro": "Dichaea cornuta, commonly known as the horned dichaea, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like structures that emerge from the stems, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Dichaea cornuta is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
