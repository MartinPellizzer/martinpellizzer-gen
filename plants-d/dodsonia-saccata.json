    "intro": "Dodsonia saccata, commonly known as the sac-like dodsonia, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, sac-like sporangia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are usually short and broad, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Its reproductive structures are clustered in sori, which are protected by a specialized indusium. Dodsonia saccata is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
