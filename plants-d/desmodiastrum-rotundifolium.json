    "intro": "Desmodiastrum rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
