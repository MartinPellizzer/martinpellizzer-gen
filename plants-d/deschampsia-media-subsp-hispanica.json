    "intro": "Deschampsia media subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
