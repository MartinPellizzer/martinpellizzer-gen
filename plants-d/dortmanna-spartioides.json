    "intro": "Dortmanna spartioides, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the Mediterranean region. It is a small, mat-forming annual that thrives in harsh coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dortmanna spartioides plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline."
