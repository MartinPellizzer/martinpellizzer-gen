    "intro": "Desmodium andersonii, commonly known as the pink burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, hairy, three-lobed pods that help in seed dispersal. Desmodium andersonii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
