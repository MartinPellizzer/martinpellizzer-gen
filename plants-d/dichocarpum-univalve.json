It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive two-seeded, single-valved fruits that open explosively upon maturity. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as temperate forests. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
