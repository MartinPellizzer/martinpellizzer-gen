It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
