    "intro": "Dalbergia multijuga, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas across sub-Saharan Africa. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
