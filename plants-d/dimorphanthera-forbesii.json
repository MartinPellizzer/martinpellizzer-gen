    "intro": "Dimorphanthera forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' dimorphanthera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a smooth surface, and the flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many parts of its native range."
