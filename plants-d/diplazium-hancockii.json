    "intro": "Diplazium hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
