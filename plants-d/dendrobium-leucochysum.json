    "intro": "Dendrobium leucochysum, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green velvety hair. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
