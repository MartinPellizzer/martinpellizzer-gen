    "intro": "Dryopteris stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas with well-drained soil. The narrow-leaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
