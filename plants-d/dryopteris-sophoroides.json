    "intro": "Dryopteris sophoroides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
