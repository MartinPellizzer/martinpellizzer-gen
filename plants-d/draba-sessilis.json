    "intro": "Draba sessilis, commonly known as the sessile whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and small, clustered flowers with four petals. Draba sessilis is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of its ecological habitat."
