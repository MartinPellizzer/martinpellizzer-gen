    "intro": "Danthonia distichophylla, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It produces small, pale green flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Danthonia distichophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
