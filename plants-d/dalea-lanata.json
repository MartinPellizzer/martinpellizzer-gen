It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and its clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Dalea lanata is a perennial herb that produces small, legume-like pods containing seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native range."
