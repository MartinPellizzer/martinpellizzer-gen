    "intro": "Desmanthus oligospermus, commonly known as the small-seeded burrlegume, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is valuable for soil enrichment and forage in ecological restoration projects."
