    "intro": "Deschampsia gracillima, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky blades and often forms dense, low-growing clumps. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. Deschampsia gracillima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
