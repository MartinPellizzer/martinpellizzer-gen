    "intro": "Duroia eriopila, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and stout, woody stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries containing small, hard seeds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, short hairs. Duroia eriopila is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
