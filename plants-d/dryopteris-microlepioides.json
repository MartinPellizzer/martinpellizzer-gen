    "intro": "Dryopteris microlepioides, commonly known as the small-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
