    "intro": "Disciphania micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered disciphania, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb or shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish or yellowish, with a distinctive disc-like structure at the center. The plant's leaves are usually smooth and have a slightly succulent texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates."
