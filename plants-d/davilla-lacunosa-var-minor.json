    "intro": "Davilla lacunosa var. minor, commonly known as the Mexican elder or dwarf davilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
