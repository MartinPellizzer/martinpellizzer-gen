    "intro": "Draba hirta var. subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a compact rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a single umbel. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes or gravelly ground. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor conditions."
