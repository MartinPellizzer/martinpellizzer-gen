    "intro": "Davilla vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or tropical hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Davilla vaginata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils."
