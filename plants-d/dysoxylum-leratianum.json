    "intro": "Dysoxylum leratianum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in brackish or saline water, making it a common species in coastal mangrove forests. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
