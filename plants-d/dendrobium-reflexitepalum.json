    "intro": "Dendrobium reflexitepalum, commonly known as the reflexed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive reflexed lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
