    "intro": "Dactylorhiza fuchsii var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in damp, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
