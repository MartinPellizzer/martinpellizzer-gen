    "intro": "Delpinoella, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. These plants are typically small shrubs or herbs, characterized by their narrow, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually pink, purple, or blue, and they bloom in spring or early summer. Delpinoella species are adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
