    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican Sundew, is a variant of the common sundew native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, sticky leaves that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths, and is often found in coastal areas. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical Drosera rotundifolia."
