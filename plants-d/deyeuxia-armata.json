    "intro": "Deyeuxia armata, commonly known as the armed sedge, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Deyeuxia armata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
