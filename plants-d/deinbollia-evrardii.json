    "intro": "Deinbollia evrardii, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
