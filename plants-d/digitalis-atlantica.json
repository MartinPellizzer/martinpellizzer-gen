    "intro": "Digitalis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It produces tall, slender stems that bear striking purple to pink flowers arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant's leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and contains cardiac glycosides, making it both poisonous and historically significant in medicine. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in maritime ecosystems."
