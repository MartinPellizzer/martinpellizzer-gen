    "intro": "Deschampsia setacea, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awn-tipped lemma-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant for erosion control."
