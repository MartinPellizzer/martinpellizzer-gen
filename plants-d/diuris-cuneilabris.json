    "intro": "Diuris cuneilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lobed spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its distinctive, spider-like appearance. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in heathlands and open forests, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hairy sepals and petals. It is pollinated by specific insect species, and its blooming period usually occurs in late winter to early spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
