It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are also sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance."
