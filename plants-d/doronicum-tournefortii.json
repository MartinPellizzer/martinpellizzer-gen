    "intro": "Doronicum tournefortii, commonly known as the alpine goldcup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
