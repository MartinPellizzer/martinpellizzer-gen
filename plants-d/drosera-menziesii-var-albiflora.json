    "intro": "Drosera menziesii var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a sugary substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in moist, acidic environments. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces a single, erect stem with rosettes of leaves. This variety is notable for its attractive appearance and unique method of obtaining nutrients through insect capture."
