    "intro": "Dalbergia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ebony, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in humid climates. Dalbergia albiflora is valued for its hard, dark timber used in traditional crafts and furniture."
