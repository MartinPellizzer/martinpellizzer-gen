    "intro": "Digitaria marginata var. extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and floodplains. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
