    "intro": "Dryopteris andreana, commonly known as the Andreana wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, elongated structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The Andreana wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
