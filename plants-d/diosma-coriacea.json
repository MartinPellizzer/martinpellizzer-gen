    "intro": "Diosma coriacea, commonly known as the rough Diosma, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. Diosma coriacea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
