    "intro": "Dysoxylum quercifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of an oak. The tree produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Dysoxylum quercifolium is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
