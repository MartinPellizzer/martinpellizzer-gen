    "intro": "Deschampsia atropurpurea var. latifolia, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and purple-tinted flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. It has a clump-forming growth habit and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects."
