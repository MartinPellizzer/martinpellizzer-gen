It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils. Discaria crenata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in landscaping for its hardy nature."
