    "intro": "Dryopteris callolepis, commonly known as the broad male fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
