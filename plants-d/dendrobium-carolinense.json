    "intro": "Dendrobium carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems forming a rosette-like structure and producing a single raceme of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Dendrobium carolinense thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods and swamps."
