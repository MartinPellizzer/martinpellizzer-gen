    "intro": "Dioscorea tashiroi, commonly known as Tashiro's yam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not widely cultivated for food. Dioscorea tashiroi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
