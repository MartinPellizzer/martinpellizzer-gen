    "intro": "Dalea coerulea, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Dalea coerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
