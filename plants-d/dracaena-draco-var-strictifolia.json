It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces a unique red sap, known as dragon's blood, which has been used historically for medicinal and artistic purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is also noted for its slow growth and ability to form a compact, tree-like structure over time."
