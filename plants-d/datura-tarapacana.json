    "intro": "Datura tarapacana, commonly known as the \"Lunar Flower\" or \"Candy Plant,\" is a striking species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, purple, or violet. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and the stems are hairy, adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Datura tarapacana is also notable for containing toxic alkaloids, making it both beautiful and potentially dangerous."
