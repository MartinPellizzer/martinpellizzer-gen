    "intro": "Drosera silvicola, commonly known as the forest sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sweet, sticky substance to lure prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in peat bogs or shaded areas. Drosera silvicola is relatively small, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters."
