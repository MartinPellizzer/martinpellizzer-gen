It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, typical of many grass species.
