    "intro": "Dichaetanthera scabra, commonly known as the rough anther grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Dichaetanthera scabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
