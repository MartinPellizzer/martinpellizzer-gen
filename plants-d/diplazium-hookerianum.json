    "intro": "Diplazium hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a membranous indusium. Diplazium hookerianum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
