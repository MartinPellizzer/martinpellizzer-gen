    "intro": "Dendropemon lepidotus subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island tree fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on certain tropical islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
