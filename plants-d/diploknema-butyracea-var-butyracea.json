    "intro": "Diploknema butyracea var. butyracea, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions, and its roots form a complex network that aids in sediment retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of fleshy, berry-like fruits. This species is also valued for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its use in traditional medicine."
