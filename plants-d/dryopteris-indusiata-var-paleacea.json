    "intro": "Dryopteris indusiata var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale indusial wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically pale green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are covered by a membranous flap known as an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
