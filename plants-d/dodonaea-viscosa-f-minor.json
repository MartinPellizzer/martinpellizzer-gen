    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa f. minor, commonly known as the silverleaf dodonaea, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to its green stems. Native to Australia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its delicate, pinkish-white flowers appear in clusters during spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is drought-tolerant and requires minimal pruning, making it a low-maintenance ornamental species. Its unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its appeal in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
