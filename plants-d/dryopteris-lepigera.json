    "intro": "Dryopteris lepigera, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a distinctive, lace-like appearance."
