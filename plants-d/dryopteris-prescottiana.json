    "intro": "Dryopteris prescottiana, commonly known as the Prescott fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, with a distinctive shape that resembles a feather. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
