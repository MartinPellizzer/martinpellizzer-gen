    "intro": "Doodia australis, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Doodia australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
