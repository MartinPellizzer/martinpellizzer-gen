    "intro": "Dryopteris ochthodes var. tylodes, commonly known as the purple frond fern, is a variant of the eastern wood fern. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often display a purplish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
