    "intro": "Dipodium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered dipodium, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
