It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive pale margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets. It is typically found in moist, temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Dinochloa marginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
