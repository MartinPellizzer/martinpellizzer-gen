It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, greenish-brown structures that produce the plant's seeds. Dichanthelium bicknellii plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
