    "intro": "Daucus carota var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy carrot, is a variant of the wild carrot species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more familiar cultivated carrot. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are generally smaller and less edible compared to the domesticated carrot, though they are still used in some traditional cuisines. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions."
