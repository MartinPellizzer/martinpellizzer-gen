    "intro": "Dictyodroma yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
