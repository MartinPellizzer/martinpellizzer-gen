    "intro": "Daphne cneorum var. abietina, commonly known as the Italian daphne, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, glossy dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers in shades of pink and white during late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its slow growth and dense, rounded form, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is generally resistant to pests and diseases. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
