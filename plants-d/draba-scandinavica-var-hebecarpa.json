    "intro": "Draba scandinavica var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the Scandinavian rockcress, is a low-growing, perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in cold climates make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
