    "intro": "Diplazium rapense, commonly known as the broadleaf button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit. The plant features large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Diplazium rapense thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in humid conditions."
