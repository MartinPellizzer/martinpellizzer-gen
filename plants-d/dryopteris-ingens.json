    "intro": "Dryopteris ingens, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
