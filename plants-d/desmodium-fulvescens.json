It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Desmodium fulvescens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
