    "intro": "Dianthus pseudorigidus, commonly known as the rigid pinks, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features upright, sparsely branched stems covered with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems, with five petals that are often adorned with a white or pale pink margin. Dianthus pseudorigidus is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought-tolerant nature."
