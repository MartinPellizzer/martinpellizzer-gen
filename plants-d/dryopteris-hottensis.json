    "intro": "Dryopteris hottensis, commonly known as the Hott's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a distinctive, segmented structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
