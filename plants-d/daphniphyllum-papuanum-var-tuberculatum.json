    "intro": "Daphniphyllum papuanum var. tuberculatum, commonly known as the Papuan waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in small, raised tubercles, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
