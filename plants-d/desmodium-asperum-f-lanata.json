    "intro": "Desmodium asperum f. lanata, commonly known as woolly burr legume, is a variant of the desmodium genus within the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by the development of hairy, spiny pods. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
