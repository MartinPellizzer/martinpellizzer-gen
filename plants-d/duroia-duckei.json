    "intro": "Duroia duckei, commonly known as the red-eyed tree frog plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Duroia duckei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory layer of the canopy."
