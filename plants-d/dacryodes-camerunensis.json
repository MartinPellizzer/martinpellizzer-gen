It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has smooth, grayish bark with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
