It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are often basal, with a distinctive rosette structure, and it produces numerous tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. This variant is noted for its adaptability to harsh, cold climates and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
