    "intro": "Duguetia stenantha, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruits that are spherical and contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
