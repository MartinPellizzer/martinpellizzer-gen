    "intro": "Dryopteris caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are borne on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often curled into a fiddlehead shape. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish strong, long-lasting colonies in its natural habitat."
