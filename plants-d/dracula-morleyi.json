    "intro": "Dracula morleyi, commonly known as the Morley's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, dark red flowers that resemble tiny, delicate bats, giving it its dramatic common name. Dracula morleyi is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat destruction and illegal collection."
