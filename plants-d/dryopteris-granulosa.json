    "intro": "Dryopteris granulosa, commonly known as the granular wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, granular texture on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris granulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
