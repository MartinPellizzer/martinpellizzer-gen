    "intro": "Dendrosida sharpiana subsp. sharpiana, commonly known as the Sharp's tree-fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorangia, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
