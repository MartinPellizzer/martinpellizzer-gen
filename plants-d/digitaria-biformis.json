    "intro": "Digitaria biformis, commonly known as two-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Digitaria biformis is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
