    "intro": "Diplazium mesosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that are covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a dense, moss-like appearance. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, almost fern-like structure. Diplazium mesosorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
