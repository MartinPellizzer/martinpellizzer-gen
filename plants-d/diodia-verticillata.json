    "intro": "Diodia verticillata, commonly known as false musk vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Diodia verticillata is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
