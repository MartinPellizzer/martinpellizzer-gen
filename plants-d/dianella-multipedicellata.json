    "intro": "Dianella multipedicellata, commonly known as the coastal dianella, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly coastal environments. Dianella multipedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
