It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Dipterygia flexuosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
