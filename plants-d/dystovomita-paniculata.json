    "intro": "Dystovomita paniculata, commonly known as the panicled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its chlorophyll-containing structures called phyllodes for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Dystovomita paniculata is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
