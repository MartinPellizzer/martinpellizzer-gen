It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a leopard's paw. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Doronicum cavillieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude environments."
