    "intro": "Dicranopteris caudata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Dicranopteris caudata is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic fern in tropical regions."
