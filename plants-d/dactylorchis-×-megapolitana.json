    "intro": "Dactylorchis \u00d7 megapolitana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Dactylorchis caryophylla and Dactylorchis macrophylla, resulting in a blend of characteristics from both parents. The plant typically produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with a complex structure featuring three sepals and three petals, and a lip that is often marked with distinctive patterns. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of forests in its native range."
