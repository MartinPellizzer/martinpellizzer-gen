    "intro": "Diplotaxis balearica, commonly known as the Balearic rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Diplotaxis balearica is often found in coastal and inland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
