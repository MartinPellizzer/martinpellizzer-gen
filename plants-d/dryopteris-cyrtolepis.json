    "intro": "Dryopteris cyrtolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a compact, dense crown of dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The fronds are leathery and remain upright throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
