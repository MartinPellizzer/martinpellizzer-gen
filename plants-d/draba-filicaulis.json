    "intro": "Draba filicaulis, commonly known as the fern-leaved whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its simple, basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Draba filicaulis is an annual or biennial herb that produces a capsule fruit containing several seeds. Its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a notable species in alpine botany."
