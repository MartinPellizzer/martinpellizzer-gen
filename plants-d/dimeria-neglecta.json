    "intro": "Dimeria neglecta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Dimeria neglecta is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions."
