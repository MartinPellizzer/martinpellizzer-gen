    "intro": "Desideria prolifera, commonly known as the creeping desideria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry conditions."
