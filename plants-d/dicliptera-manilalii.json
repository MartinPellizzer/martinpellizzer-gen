    "intro": "Dicliptera manilalii, commonly known as the Malabar grass, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of southern India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are usually hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
