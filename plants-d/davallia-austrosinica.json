    "intro": "Davallia austrosinica, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the air. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
