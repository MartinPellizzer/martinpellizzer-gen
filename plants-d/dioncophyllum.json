    "intro": "Dioncophyllum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Dioncophyllum species are known for their ability to accumulate toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
