    "intro": "Dalbergia kisantuensis, commonly known as the Kisantu rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforest areas. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
