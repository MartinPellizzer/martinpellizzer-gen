It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with glandular dots along the veins, which give it its common name. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a loose cluster and bloom in the summer months. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
