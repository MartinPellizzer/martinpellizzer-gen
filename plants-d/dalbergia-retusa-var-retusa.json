It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits containing smooth, hard seeds. It is valued for its timber, which is used in furniture and carving, as well as for its seeds, which are a source of shea butter. The plant also plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
