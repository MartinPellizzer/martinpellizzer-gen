    "intro": "Danthonia cumminsii, commonly known as the Cummins' grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Danthonia cumminsii is often found in coastal regions and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
