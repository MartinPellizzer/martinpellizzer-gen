    "intro": "Dracaena ebracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red or orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena ebracteata is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying properties."
