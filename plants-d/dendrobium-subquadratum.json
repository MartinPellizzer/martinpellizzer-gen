    "intro": "Dendrobium subquadratum, commonly known as the quadrilateral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a cane-like stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its flowers are typically borne in racemes and bloom during the summer months. Dendrobium subquadratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
