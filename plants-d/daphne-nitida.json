    "intro": "Daphne nitida, commonly known as silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of pink or white. Its bark is smooth and often peels to reveal a mottled, flaky texture. Daphne nitida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
