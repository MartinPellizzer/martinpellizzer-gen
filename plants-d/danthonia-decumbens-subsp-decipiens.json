    "intro": "Danthonia decumbens subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid or dry environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
