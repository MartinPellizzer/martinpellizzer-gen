    "intro": "Dryopteris vogelii, commonly known as Vogel's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
