    "intro": "Dalbergia erubescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
