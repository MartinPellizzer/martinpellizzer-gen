    "intro": "Dendrobium tanjiewhoei, commonly known as the Tanjiewhoei orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium tanjiewhoei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
