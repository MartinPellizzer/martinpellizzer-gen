    "intro": "Delphinium cossonianum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a coarse texture, often with a bluish-green hue. Delphinium cossonianum var. laxiflorum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal but is toxic to livestock and humans due to its high concentration of alkaloids."
