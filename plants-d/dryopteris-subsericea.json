It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces compound leaves with a pinnate structure. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
