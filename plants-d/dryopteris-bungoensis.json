    "intro": "Dryopteris bungoensis, commonly known as the Bungo fern, is a species of shield fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fertile fronds. Dryopteris bungoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
