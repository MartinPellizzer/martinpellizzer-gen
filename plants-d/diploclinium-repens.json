    "intro": "Diploclinium repens, commonly known as creeping diploclinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Diploclinium repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
