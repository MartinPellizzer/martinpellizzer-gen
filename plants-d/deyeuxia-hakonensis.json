    "intro": "Deyeuxia hakonensis, commonly known as the Hakon's false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
