    "intro": "Dorstenia marijan-matokii, commonly known as the Marijan-Matoki dwarf fig, is a unique species native to the rainforests of East Africa. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically consumed raw, though they are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, making it an attractive ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
