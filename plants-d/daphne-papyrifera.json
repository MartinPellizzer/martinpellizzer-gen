    "intro": "Daphne papyrifera, commonly known as the paperleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble paper, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
