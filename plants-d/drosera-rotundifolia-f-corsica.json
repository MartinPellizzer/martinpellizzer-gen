    "intro": "Drosera rotundifolia f. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican round-leaved sundew, is a variant of the common sundew characterized by its compact growth habit and slightly smaller leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insect prey. Its leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette, with a reddish hue that becomes more pronounced under stress or in full sun. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
