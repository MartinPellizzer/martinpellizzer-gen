It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
