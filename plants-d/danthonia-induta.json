    "intro": "Danthonia induta, commonly known as the slender danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help it spread and establish dense vegetation. Danthonia induta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in sandy or coastal environments."
