    "intro": "Davallia domingensis, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Davallia domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor settings or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
