    "intro": "Draba franktonii, commonly known as Frankton's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Draba franktonii is perennial, with basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
