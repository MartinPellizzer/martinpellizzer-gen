    "intro": "Dignathia villosa, commonly known as the hairy thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Dignathia villosa is often found in dry, open areas and can thrive in disturbed soils."
