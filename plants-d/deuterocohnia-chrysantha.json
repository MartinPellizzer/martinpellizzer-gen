    "intro": "Deuterocohnia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden moss cushion, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Deuterocohnia chrysantha is well adapted to rocky substrates and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
