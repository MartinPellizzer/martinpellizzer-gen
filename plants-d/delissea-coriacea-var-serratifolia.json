It features distinctive, thick, leathery leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections."
