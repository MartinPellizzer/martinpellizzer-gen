It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Dortmanna fulgens is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
