    "intro": "Dennstaedtia pavonii, commonly known as the red fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
