It features bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lance-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture. The fronds can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
