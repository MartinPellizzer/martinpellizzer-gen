    "intro": "Dumasia miaoliensis, commonly known as the Miaoli dumasia, is a rare flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dumasia miaoliensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
