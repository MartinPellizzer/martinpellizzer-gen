    "intro": "Dendromyza cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths. The orchid's root system is specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches."
