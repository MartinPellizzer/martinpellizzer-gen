    "intro": "Dilophotriche tristachyoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
