    "intro": "Dendrobium superbum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet lip orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Australian Alps. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is an epiphyte, growing on trees or rocks in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a deep red lip, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and ample sunlight. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
