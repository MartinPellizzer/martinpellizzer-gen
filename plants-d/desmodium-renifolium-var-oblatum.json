It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
