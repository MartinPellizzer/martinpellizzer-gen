It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions makes it an excellent plant for landscaping in dry climates."
