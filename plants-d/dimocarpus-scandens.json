    "intro": "Dimocarpus scandens, commonly known as the climbing tamarind, is a tropical shrub or vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody, angular fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's unique structure and flavor have made it a subject of botanical interest. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
