It features dense, fragrant clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
