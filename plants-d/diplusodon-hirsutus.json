    "intro": "Diplusodon hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy diplusodon, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which provide protection against herbivory and moisture loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Diplusodon hirsutus is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
