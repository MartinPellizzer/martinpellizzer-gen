    "intro": "Delissea coriacea var. lumahaiensis, commonly known as the Lumahai sandmat, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Hawaii. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
