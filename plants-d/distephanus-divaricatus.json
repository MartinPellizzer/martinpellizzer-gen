    "intro": "Distephanus divaricatus, commonly known as the spiral tree, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern, where branches twist around the trunk in a helical manner. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Distephanus divaricatus is a striking example of adaptive morphology in the plant kingdom."
