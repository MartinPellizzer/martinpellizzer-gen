    "intro": "Dendrobium sexcostatum, commonly known as the six-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems that are often segmented and covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with a distinctive six-ribbed structure on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
