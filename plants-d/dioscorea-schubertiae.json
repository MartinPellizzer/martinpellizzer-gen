    "intro": "Dioscorea schubertiae, commonly known as the Schubert yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. These tubers are often used in traditional cuisine and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Dioscorea schubertiae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
