    "intro": "Dianthus emarginatus, commonly known as the fringed pink, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers with fringed petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Dianthus emarginatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
