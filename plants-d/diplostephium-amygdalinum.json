    "intro": "Diplostephium amygdalinum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain a toxic compound called amygdalin, which is also found in bitter almonds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
