    "intro": "Dryopteris pontica, commonly known as the Carpathian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris pontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
