    "intro": "Durabaculum pseudoconanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its striking, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Durabaculum pseudoconanthum is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
