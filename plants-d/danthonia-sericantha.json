    "intro": "Danthonia sericantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
