    "intro": "Dombeya orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
