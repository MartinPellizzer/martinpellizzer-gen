It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. The plant is known for its tuberous roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
