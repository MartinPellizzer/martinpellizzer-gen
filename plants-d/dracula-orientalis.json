    "intro": "Dracula orientalis, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, dark red or purple flowers that resemble the fangs of a vampire, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
