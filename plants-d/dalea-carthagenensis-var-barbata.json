    "intro": "Dalea carthagenensis var. barbata, commonly known as the barbed prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its barbed bracts, which give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal."
