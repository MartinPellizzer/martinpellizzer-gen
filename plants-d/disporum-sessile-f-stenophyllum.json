    "intro": "Disporum sessile f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved disporum, is a variant of the broadleaf disporum native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically shorter and more upright compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Liliaceae family."
