    "intro": "Dubautia montana, commonly known as mountain dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Dubautia montana is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is often found in conservation areas."
