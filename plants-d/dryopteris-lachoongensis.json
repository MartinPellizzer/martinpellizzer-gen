    "intro": "Dryopteris lachoongensis, commonly known as the Lachoong fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense, dark green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
