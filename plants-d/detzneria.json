    "intro": "Detzneria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its unique growth habit, often appearing as a cluster of small, ephemeral blooms that open only under specific environmental conditions. Detzneria is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its purported healing abilities. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
