It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Dimetra is often used in traditional Native American practices for its medicinal and spiritual properties. Its essential oils are also utilized in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
