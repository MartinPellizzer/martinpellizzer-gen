    "intro": "Dryopteris tephrophylla, commonly known as the tephrophylla wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
