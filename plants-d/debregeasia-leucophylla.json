    "intro": "Debregeasia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed debregeasia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are notably white or pale green, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
