    "intro": "Draba supravillosa, commonly known as the alpine whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba supravillosa is adapted to cold climates and is part of the mustard family, Brassicaceae."
