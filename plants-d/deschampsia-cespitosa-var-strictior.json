It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
