    "intro": "Dianthus altaicus, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Dianthus altaicus is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
