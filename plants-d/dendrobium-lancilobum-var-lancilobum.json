    "intro": "Dendrobium lancilobum var. lancilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinct, lance-shaped petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine, white pubescence."
