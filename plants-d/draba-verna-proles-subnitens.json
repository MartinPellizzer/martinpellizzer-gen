    "intro": "Draba verna proles subnitens, commonly known as the early spring whitlow grass, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. It has a short growing season and is adapted to cold climates, blooming before the full onset of warmer weather. Its presence indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
