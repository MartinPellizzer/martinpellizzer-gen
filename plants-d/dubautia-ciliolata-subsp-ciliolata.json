    "intro": "Dubautia ciliolata subsp. ciliolata, commonly known as the Hawaiian silversword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in the wet, cool climates of Hawaii's high elevations, typically on wind-swept slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the island's biodiversity and conservation efforts."
