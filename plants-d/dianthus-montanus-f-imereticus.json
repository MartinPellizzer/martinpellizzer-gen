    "intro": "Dianthus montanus f. imereticus, commonly known as the alpine pinks, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, helping to anchor it in rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its resilience and beauty."
