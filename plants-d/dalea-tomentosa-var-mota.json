    "intro": "Dalea tomentosa var. mota, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces fluffy, pink to reddish-purple flower clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia. It is also valued in restoration projects for its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
