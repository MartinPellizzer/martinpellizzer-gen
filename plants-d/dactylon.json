    "intro": "Dactylon, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Dactylon species are perennial herbs that can spread through rhizomes, forming dense vegetation. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
