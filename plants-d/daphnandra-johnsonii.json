    "intro": "Daphnandra johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's daphnandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
