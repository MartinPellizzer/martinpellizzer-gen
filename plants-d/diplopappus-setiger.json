    "intro": "Diplopappus setiger, commonly known as the hooked sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, typical of the family. Its unique feature is the presence of hooked bracts beneath the flower heads, which aid in seed dispersal. Diplopappus setiger thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils."
