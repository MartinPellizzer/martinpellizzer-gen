It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
