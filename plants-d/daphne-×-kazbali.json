    "intro": "Daphne \u00d7 kazbali, commonly known as the Kazbali daphne, is a hybrid shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
