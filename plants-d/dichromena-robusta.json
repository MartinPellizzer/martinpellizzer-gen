    "intro": "Dichromena robusta, commonly known as the robust dichromena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, yellow-orange petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Dichromena robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
