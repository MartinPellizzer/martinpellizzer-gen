    "intro": "Dregeochloa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a small, mat-forming grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces small, pale green or brownish flower spikes that are clustered at the ends of the stems. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
