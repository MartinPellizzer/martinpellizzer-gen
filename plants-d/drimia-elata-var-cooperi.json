It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale blue flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
