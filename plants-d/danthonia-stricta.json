    "intro": "Danthonia stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf wintergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Danthonia stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
