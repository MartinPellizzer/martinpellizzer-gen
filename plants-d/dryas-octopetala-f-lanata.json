    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. lanata, commonly known as the woolly mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster of eight, giving it the species name \"octopetala.\" Its leaves are typically rounded and have a leathery texture, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is often found growing in rocky soils and open habitats at high elevations."
