    "intro": "Dendrophthora dodsonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for native birds. It is typically found growing on the branches of Metrosideros species, such as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, Dendrophthora dodsonii is considered endangered and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of Hawaii."
