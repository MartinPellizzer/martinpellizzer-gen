    "intro": "Dryopteris canalensis, commonly known as the Canal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The Canal fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, attractive clumps over time."
