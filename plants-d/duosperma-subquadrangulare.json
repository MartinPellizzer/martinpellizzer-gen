    "intro": "Duosperma subquadrangulare, commonly known as the quadrangular morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in some areas."
