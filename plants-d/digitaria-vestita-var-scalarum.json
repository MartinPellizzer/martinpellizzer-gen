    "intro": "Digitaria vestita var. scalarum, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
