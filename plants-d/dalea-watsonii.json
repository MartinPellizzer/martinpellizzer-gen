It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Dalea watsonii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
