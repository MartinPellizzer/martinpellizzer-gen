    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. ranunculifolium, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that give the plant a delicate, lacey appearance. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and prefers well-drained, rocky soils."
