It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
