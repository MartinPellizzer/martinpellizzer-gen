It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris nephrodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its lush, tropical appearance."
