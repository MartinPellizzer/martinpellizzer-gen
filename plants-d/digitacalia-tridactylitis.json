It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are usually greenish or brownish in color. Digitacalia tridactylitis is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
