    "intro": "Dryopteris shiroumensis, commonly known as the Shiroumensis wood fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure."
