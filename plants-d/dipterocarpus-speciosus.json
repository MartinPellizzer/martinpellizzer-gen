It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 40 meters in height, and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces large, woody fruits containing oily seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in its natural habitat. This species plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of tropical rainforests."
