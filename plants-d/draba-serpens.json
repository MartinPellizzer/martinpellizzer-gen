    "intro": "Draba serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Draba serpens is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in snowfields. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
