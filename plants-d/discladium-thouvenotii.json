It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from December to March. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates with high salt exposure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the stems are often covered in a fine, white powder.
