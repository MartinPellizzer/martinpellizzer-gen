    "intro": "Dalea albiflora var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the whiteflower prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, and its seed pods are slender and hairy. This variety is distinguished by its short, bract-like structures at the base of its flowers, which give it its specific name."
