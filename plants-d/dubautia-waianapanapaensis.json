    "intro": "Dubautia waianapanapaensis, commonly known as the Waianapanapa dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the late winter to spring months. It thrives in coastal habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
