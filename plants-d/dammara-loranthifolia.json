    "intro": "Dammara loranthifolia, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Indian subcontinent. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Dammara loranthifolia plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by interacting with both its host trees and other organisms."
