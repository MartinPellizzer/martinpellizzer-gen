    "intro": "Dicoryphe stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
