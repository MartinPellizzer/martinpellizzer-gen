    "intro": "Dactylorhiza cordigera var. rochelii, commonly known as the Rochel's yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green to orange flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance."
