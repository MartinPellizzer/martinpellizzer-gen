    "intro": "Dracaena thomiae, commonly known as the Madagascar dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a silver-green underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements. Dracaena thomiae is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ornamental appeal."
