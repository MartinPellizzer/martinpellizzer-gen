    "intro": "Digitaria breedlovei, commonly known as the breedlove panicgrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
