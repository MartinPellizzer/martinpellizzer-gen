    "intro": "Drosophyllum, commonly known as the \"honeyplant,\" is a carnivorous plant native to the Canary Islands. It possesses specialized leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-like substance to trap insects. The plant's structure includes long, narrow leaves that curl around prey, facilitating digestion. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its native habitat. Its unique morphology and predatory behavior make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
