    "intro": "Distimake kentrocaulos, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its fruit, a small, smooth berry, contains toxic alkaloids and is not suitable for human consumption. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and gardening practices."
