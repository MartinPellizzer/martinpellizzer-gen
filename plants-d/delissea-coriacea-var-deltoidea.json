It features thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
