    "intro": "Diplactis caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian Diplactis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include a woody stem and palmate leaves, which are adapted to its cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diplactis caucasica is considered a vulnerable species."
