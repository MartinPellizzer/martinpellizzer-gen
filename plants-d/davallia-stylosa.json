    "intro": "Davallia stylosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically covered by a protective indusium."
