It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often ribbed stems that can grow quite tall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element. Its leaves are broad and paddle-shaped, which distinguishes it from other cactus varieties. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water."
