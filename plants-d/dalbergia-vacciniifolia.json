    "intro": "Dalbergia vacciniifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or pinkwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by small, round fruits. The species is also noted for its slow growth and is considered a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
