    "intro": "Diplycosia pittosporifolia var. punctiloba, commonly known as the spotted diplycosia, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
