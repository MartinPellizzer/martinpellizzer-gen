    "intro": "Dioscorea remota, commonly known as the remote yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody fruits containing toxic, angular seeds. Its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they contain harmful compounds. Due to its toxicity, careful handling and preparation are necessary for any potential use."
