    "intro": "Dichaea latifolia var. longa, commonly known as the long-leaved broadleaf dichaea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that can grow quite long, often reaching several inches in length. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, emerging from the base of the leaf rosette. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
