    "intro": "Dendroglossa subquinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed tree toad, is a species of tree frog native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed vocal sac, which is prominent in males during mating calls. The plant-like name may be a misnomer, as it refers to the frog rather than a botanical species. This frog typically inhabits humid forest environments, where it can be found perched on leaves or in the canopy. Its botanical features are not applicable, as it is an amphibian, not a plant."
