    "intro": "Dendrobium milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically clustered and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Dendrobium milliganii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
