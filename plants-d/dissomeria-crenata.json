    "intro": "Dissomeria crenata, commonly known as the crested dwarf lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, wavy-edged leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
