    "intro": "Daviesia ericoides, commonly known as the pink bough daphne, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, typically appearing in pairs along the stems. Daviesia ericoides is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
