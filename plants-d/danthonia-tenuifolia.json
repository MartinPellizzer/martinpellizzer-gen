    "intro": "Danthonia tenuifolia, commonly known as slender feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, fine-textured leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Danthonia tenuifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
