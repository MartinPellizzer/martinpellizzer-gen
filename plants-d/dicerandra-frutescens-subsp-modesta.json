    "intro": "Dicerandra frutescens subsp. modesta, commonly known as the modest dicerandra, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is often found in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwood habitats. It produces a distinct, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
