    "intro": "Delphinium sierrae-blancae, commonly known as Sierra White Delphinium, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium sierrae-blancae is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer."
