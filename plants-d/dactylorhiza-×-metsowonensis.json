    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 metsowonensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces spikes of pale yellow to greenish-white blooms, which are often adorned with purple or brown markings. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and marshes, often growing in dense colonies. Dactylorhiza \u00d7 metsowonensis is known for its ability to hybridize with other Dactylorhiza species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
