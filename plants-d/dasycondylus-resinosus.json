    "intro": "Dasycondylus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous shield fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in a waxy, resinous coating, which helps protect it from desiccation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
