    "intro": "Diplazium asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil or rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
