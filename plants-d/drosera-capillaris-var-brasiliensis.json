    "intro": "Drosera capillaris var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are small and clustered, forming a rosette structure that helps retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
