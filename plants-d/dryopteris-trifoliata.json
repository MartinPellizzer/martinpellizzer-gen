    "intro": "Dryopteris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-foliolate wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features a distinctive frond structure with triangular pinnae that are often divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in woodland ecosystems."
