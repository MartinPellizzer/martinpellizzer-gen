    "intro": "Dendropanax maritimus, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important part of the coastal flora and an indicator of maritime ecosystems."
