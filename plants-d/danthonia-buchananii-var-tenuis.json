    "intro": "Danthonia buchananii var. tenuis, commonly known as slender danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa. It forms dense, mat-like turf with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively in its native habitat."
