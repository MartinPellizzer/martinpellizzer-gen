    "intro": "Daphne kamtschatica subsp. jezoensis, commonly known as the Jezoensis Daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing an attractive contrast to its showy blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in temperate climates."
