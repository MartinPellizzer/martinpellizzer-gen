    "intro": "Didymochlaena truncatula var. ozeanica, commonly known as the Oceanic Didymochlaena, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal conditions."
