    "intro": "Drymaria divaricata var. divergens, commonly known as the spreading sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its branching habit and succulent foliage make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. It is often found in dunes and other coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
