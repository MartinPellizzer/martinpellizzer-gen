    "intro": "Dipteryx pterota, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
