    "intro": "Dryopteris calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps. It is characterized by its upright, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups. Dryopteris calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
