    "intro": "Digitaria fumida, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
