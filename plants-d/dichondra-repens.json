    "intro": "Dichondra repens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. Dichondra repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
