    "intro": "Dianthus superbus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
