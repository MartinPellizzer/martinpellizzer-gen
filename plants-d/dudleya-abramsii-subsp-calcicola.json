    "intro": "Dudleya abramsii subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the coastal dudleya, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of California. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
