    "intro": "Dryopteris fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
