    "intro": "Diplazium grashoffii, commonly known as the Grashoff's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, feather-like segments. It produces spores rather than seeds, which it releases into the water for propagation. Due to its preference for clean water, it is often used as an indicator of water quality in its habitat."
