    "intro": "Desmanthus tenuifolius, commonly known as slender-leaf desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often hairy, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration and forage production. Its seeds are also used as a food source for wildlife and livestock."
