    "intro": "Dressleria allenii, commonly known as the Allen's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble skeletal structures. The plant has a short, slender stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated by specific species of wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Dressleria allenii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian law."
