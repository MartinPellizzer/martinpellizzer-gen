    "intro": "Dalechampia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions."
