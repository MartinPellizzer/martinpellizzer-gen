    "intro": "Dendrobium hollrungii, commonly known as the Orchid of the Southern Mountains, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can store water and nutrients, which is an adaptation to its often dry and shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Dendrobium hollrungii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
