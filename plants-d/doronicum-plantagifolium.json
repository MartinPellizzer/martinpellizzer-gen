It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
