    "intro": "Dryopteris incrassata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, broad, shield-shaped outline. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients, which contributes to its hardiness. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second, producing spores on the underside."
