    "intro": "Dryopteris chaerophylloides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
