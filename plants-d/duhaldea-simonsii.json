    "intro": "Duhaldea simonsii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, it is often found in desert ecosystems."
