The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
