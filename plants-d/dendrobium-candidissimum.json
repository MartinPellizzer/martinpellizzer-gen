    "intro": "Dendrobium candidissimum, commonly known as the white lady or white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate, fragrant appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
