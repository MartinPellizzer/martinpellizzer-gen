    "intro": "Dryopteris tenuissima var. serrata, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Japan. It features delicate, finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 cm, making it ideal for small garden spaces or container gardening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, which remains fresh throughout the growing season."
