    "intro": "Dioscorea loheri, commonly known as the African yambean, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its tubers are rich in starch and have a flavor similar to yams, making them a valuable food source in some regions. The plant also contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic applications."
