    "intro": "Dactylorhiza praetermissa var. elata, commonly known as the tall marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and damp woodlands. The plant features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting a dense spike of pale purple to white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This orchid is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
