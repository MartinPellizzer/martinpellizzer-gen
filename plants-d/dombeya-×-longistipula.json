    "intro": "Dombeya \u00d7 longistipula, commonly known as the long-stemmed dombeya, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Dombeya \u00d7 longistipula is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in supporting local wildlife."
