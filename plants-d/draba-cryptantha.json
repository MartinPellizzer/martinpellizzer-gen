    "intro": "Draba cryptantha, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Draba cryptantha is adapted to cold climates and can often be found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its short stature and compact growth form help it survive in harsh, wind-swept environments."
