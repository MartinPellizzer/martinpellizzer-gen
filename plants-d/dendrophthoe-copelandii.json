    "intro": "Dendrophthoe copelandii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with the host, extracting water and minerals through specialized structures called haustoria. Dendrophthoe copelandii is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, contributing to the complex ecological interactions within tropical forests."
