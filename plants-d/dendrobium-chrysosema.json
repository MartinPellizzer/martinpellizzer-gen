It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, golden-yellow flowers with a red throat. It blooms during the warmer months, typically from spring to summer. Dendrobium chrysosema is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
