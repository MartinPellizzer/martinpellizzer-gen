It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that surround its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a hairy stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its distinctive, thistle-like appearance. The species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
