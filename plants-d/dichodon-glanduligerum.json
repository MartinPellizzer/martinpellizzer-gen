    "intro": "Dichodon glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular dichondra, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features prostrate stems that produce numerous small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. Dichodon glanduligerum is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
