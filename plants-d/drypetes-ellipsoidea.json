It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. The tree is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
