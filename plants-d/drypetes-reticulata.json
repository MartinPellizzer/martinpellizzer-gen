    "intro": "Drypetes reticulata, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and distinctive reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
