    "intro": "Dryopteris decadens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically a deep green with a golden or bronze hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Dryopteris decadens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
