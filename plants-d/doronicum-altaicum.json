    "intro": "Doronicum altaicum, commonly known as the Alpine goldcup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations. Doronicum altaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
