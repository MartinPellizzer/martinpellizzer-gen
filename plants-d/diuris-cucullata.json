    "intro": "Diuris cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. The plant features a single, erect stem with a cluster of elongated, hood-like flowers that are usually greenish-brown with purple or pink markings. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
