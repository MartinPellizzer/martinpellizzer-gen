    "intro": "Dendrobium teijsmannii, commonly known as the Java orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb system that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern. Dendrobium teijsmannii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
