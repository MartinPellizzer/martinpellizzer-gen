    "intro": "Dryopteris rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
