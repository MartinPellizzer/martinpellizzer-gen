It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are usually covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
