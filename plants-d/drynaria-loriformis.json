    "intro": "Drynaria loriformis, commonly known as the fan-ferns, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous small, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Drynaria loriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
