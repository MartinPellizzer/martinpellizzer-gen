    "intro": "Dentaria rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf toothwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of rounded, tooth-like leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single upright stem bearing small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Dentaria rotundifolia is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local pollinators."
