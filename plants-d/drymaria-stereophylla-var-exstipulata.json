    "intro": "Drymaria stereophylla var. exstipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
