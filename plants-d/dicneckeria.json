    "intro": "Dicneckeria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific host trees for support, often growing as an epiphyte without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Dicneckeria is listed as endangered in several regions."
