    "intro": "Doryopteris concolor var. kirkii, commonly known as the K Kirk's holly fern, is a variant of the broadleaf holly fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that retains its color throughout the year. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, broad, and often arching shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, humid climates."
