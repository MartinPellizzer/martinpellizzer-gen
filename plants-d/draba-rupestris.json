    "intro": "Draba rupestris, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Draba rupestris is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
