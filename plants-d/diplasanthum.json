    "intro": "Diplasanthum, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplasanthum thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas. Its botanical name reflects its unique floral structure, which differs from other milkweed species."
