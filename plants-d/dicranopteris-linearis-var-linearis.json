It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
