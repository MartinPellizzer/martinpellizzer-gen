    "intro": "Dryopteris glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in small, rounded scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris glabrata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens."
