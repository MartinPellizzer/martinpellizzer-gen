It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as pastures and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
