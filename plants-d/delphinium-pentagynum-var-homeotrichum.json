    "intro": "Delphinium pentagynum var. homeotrichum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with whorled, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers have five sepals that are often mistaken for petals, a characteristic feature of the Delphinium genus. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, rocky environments."
