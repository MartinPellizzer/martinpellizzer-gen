    "intro": "Dendrobium nienkui, commonly known as the Nienkui orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium nienkui is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
