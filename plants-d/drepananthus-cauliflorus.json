    "intro": "Drepananthus cauliflorus, commonly known as the calico flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers they enclose. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is known for its tropical appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are sturdy and somewhat woody. The plant is adapted to humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas."
