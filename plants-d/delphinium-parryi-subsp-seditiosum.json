It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often in meadows or open woodlands. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces follicles as its fruit type.
