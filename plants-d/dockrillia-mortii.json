    "intro": "Dockrillia mortii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the dense, shaded understories of temperate forests. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of ancient manuscripts. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dockrillia mortii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
