    "intro": "Distichirhops megale, commonly known as the giant star-stemmed grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with small, white to pale green flowers arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in grassland ecosystems. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes."
