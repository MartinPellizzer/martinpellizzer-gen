It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it produces small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in mesic to dry environments."
