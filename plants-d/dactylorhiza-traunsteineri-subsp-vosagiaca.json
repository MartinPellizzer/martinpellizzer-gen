    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. vosagiaca, commonly known as the Vosagian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and bogs. The plant produces tall, slender stems with few leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike. It has a rhizomatous root system and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
