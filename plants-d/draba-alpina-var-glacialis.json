    "intro": "Draba alpina var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine winter cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves and small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can survive in snow-covered conditions during winter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous regions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine ecosystems."
