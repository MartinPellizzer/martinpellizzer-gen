    "intro": "Dipteracanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowering pattern and leaf structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
