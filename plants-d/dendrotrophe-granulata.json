    "intro": "Dendrotrophe granulata, commonly known as the granulated bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on tree bark in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, granular thallus structure and a pale to yellowish-green coloration. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is often found on the bark of deciduous trees such as oaks and maples. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for forest health and biodiversity."
