    "intro": "Dendrobium listeroglossum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium listeroglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
