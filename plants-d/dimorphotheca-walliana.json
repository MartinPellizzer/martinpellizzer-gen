    "intro": "Dimorphotheca walliana, commonly known as the silver daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Dimorphotheca walliana is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
