    "intro": "Dryopteris imbricata, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris imbricata is a hardy perennial that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
