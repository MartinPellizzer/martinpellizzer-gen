    "intro": "Dendrobium viridulum, commonly known as the green dendrobium, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in two rows along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
