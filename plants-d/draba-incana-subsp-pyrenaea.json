    "intro": "Draba incana subsp. pyrenaea, commonly known as the alpine whitlow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and basal leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Draba species, including its leaf shape and flower color."
