    "intro": "Dryopteris subspinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its erect, often branched fronds that are covered with small, spinulose (spiny) scales, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
