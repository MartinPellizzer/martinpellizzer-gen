    "intro": "Dubautia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' iceplant, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Dubautia menziesii is often found in rocky areas and coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
