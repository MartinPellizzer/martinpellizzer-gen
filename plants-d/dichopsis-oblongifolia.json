    "intro": "Dichopsis oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dichopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Dichopsis oblongifolia is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
