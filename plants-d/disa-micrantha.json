    "intro": "Disa micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or the pink disa, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to its arid environment. Disa micrantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
