    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas var. affinis, commonly known as the European male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered at the base of the fronds and contribute to its reproductive cycle. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
