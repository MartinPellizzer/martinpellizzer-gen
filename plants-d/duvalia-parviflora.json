    "intro": "Duvalia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered duvalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
