    "intro": "Discogyne, commonly known as the \"sunflower of the sea,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. These plants are typically found in coastal regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Discogyne species are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange flower heads, which resemble sunflowers. They have a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. These plants play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
