    "intro": "Dendrochilum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed tree orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a contrasting lip. It grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the wild, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
