    "intro": "Dryopteris guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi wood fern, is a species of fern native to southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
