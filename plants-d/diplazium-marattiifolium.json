    "intro": "Diplazium marattiifolium, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with long, narrow pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, almost feather-like pattern. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
