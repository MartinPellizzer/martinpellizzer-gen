    "intro": "Dryopteris ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Dryopteris ensiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
