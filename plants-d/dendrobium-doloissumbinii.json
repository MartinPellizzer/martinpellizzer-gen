    "intro": "Dendrobium doloissumbinii, commonly known as the Doloissumbin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like. It produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
