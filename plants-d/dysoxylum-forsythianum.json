    "intro": "Dysoxylum forsythianum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help it stabilize in waterlogged soils. The plant has dark, smooth bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red pulp. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
