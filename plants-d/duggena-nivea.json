    "intro": "Duggena nivea, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, creating a striking visual contrast against its silvery-green foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine displays. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Duggena nivea is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
