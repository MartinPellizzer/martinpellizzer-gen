    "intro": "Dianella coronata, commonly known as the crowned lily or New Zealand flax, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense, upright clump. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Dianella coronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional M\u0101ori practices."
