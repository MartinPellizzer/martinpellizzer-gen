    "intro": "Daucus communis subsp. mauritanicus, commonly known as the Mauritania carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is native to North Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has finely divided, feathery leaves. Its roots are typically small and not as developed as those of cultivated carrots. It is valued for its potential in genetic research and as a source of wild edible plants."
