    "intro": "Dorycnium jordanianum var. decumbens, commonly known as the Jordanian goat's beard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits in dryland habitats."
