    "intro": "Dysphania dunosa, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread in various environments. Dysphania dunosa is often considered a weed but can also serve as a food source for some wildlife."
