    "intro": "Dryopteris ciliata, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium."
