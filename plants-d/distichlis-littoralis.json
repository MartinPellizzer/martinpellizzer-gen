    "intro": "Distichlis littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species for stabilizing coastal soils. Distichlis littoralis plays a vital role in the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
