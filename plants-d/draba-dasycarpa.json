    "intro": "Draba dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and is typically found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions. Draba dasycarpa is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing rocky and mountainous terrains."
