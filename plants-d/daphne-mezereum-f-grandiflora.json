    "intro": "Daphne mezereum f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered mezereum, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant, and often pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that mature in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
