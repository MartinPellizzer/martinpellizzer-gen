    "intro": "Draba nemorosa var. brevisilicula, commonly known as the short-silique rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early spring. Its short, narrow silique fruits distinguish it from other Draba species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments."
