    "intro": "Delphinium autumnale, commonly known as the autumn delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense, elongated spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Delphinium autumnale prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
