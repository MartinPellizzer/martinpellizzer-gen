    "intro": "Doliocarpus hispidobaccatus, commonly known as the rough-leaved doliocarpus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
