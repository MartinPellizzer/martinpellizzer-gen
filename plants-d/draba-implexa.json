    "intro": "Draba implexa, commonly known as the clustered whitlow grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms compact, low-growing clusters. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba implexa is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. Its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
