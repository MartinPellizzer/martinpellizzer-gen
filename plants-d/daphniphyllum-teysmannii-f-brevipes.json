    "intro": "Daphniphyllum teysmannii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed daphniphyllum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
