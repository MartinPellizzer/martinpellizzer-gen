It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and bi-lobed fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
