    "intro": "Derris tonkinensis var. compacta, commonly known as the compact derris, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing toxic seeds. It is notable for its high concentration of rotenone, a natural insecticide, making it valuable in traditional agriculture. However, due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
