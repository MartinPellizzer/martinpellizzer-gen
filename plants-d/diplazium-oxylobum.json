    "intro": "Diplazium oxylobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has a rhizome that supports the growth of its fertile and sterile fronds. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a leathery texture with a distinctively narrow shape. Diplazium oxylobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
