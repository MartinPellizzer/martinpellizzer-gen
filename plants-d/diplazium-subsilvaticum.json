    "intro": "Diplazium subsilvaticum, commonly known as the forest brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories across Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
