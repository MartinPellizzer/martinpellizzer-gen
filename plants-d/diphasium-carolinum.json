    "intro": "Diphasium carolinum, commonly known as the Carolina false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant, a trait known as monoecious. The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most species of Urtica."
