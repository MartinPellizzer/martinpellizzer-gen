    "intro": "Diplazium cubense, commonly known as Cuban water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Diplazium cubense plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
