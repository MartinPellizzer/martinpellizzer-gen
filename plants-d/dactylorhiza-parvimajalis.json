    "intro": "Dactylorhiza parvimajalis, commonly known as the small-flowered bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens. The plant has a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Dactylorhiza parvimajalis is a rare and protected species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
