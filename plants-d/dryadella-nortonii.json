    "intro": "Dryadella nortonii, commonly known as the Norton's dryad, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
