    "intro": "Delphinium intermedium var. ranunculifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are palmately compound, with broad, ovate leaflets that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
