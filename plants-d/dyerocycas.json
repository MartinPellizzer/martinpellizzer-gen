    "intro": "Dyerocycas, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves. They are typically evergreen and can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Dyerocycas species are known for their slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. The plant's unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
