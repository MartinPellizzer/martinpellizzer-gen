    "intro": "Dressleriopsis panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the humid air. Its floral structure includes three sepals and three petals, with a highly specialized labellum that plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
