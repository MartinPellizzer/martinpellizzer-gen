These plants are characterized by their delicate, hair-like stems and small, closely packed leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests or on the edges of streams. Drepadenium species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in high humidity. Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an important component of many forest ecosystems."
