    "intro": "Draba trichella, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically between March and May. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Draba trichella is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
