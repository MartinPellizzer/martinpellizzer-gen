It is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by beetles. Its trunk is often swollen and can develop aerial roots, which help it anchor to trees in its natural habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
