    "intro": "Drimys xerophila var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine drimys, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
