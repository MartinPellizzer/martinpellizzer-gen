    "intro": "Draco dracunculus, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique plant with a distinctive botanical structure. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, spore-bearing fronds that resemble a dragon's tongue. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to the soil and supports its growth. Its leaves are divided into two main parts: a sterile lower portion and a fertile upper portion that produces spores. Draco dracunculus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions."
