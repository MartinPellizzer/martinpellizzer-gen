    "intro": "Delphinium pseudomosoynense var. subglabrum, commonly known as the glabrous delphinium, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance. The variety subglabrum is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving the plant a smoother texture compared to other varieties."
