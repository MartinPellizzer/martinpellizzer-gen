    "intro": "Draba verna var. americana, commonly known as the American winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lobed or divided. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and along roadsides. This species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession."
