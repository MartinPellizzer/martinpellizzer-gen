    "intro": "Draco ombet, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its tall, umbrella-shaped crown of feathery leaves and a thick, gnarled trunk that stores water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its sap, which resembles blood when cut, has been historically used in traditional medicine and dyes. The plant's adaptations to arid environments make it a striking example of evolutionary resilience."
