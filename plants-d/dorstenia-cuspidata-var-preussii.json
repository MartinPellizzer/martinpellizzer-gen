    "intro": "Dorstenia cuspidata var. preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's woolly begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy stems, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and can vary in size, sometimes featuring a waxy coating. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight."
