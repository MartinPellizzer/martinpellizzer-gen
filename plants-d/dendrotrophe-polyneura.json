    "intro": "Dendrotrophe polyneura, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that have a distinctive white vascular pattern visible on their undersides. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Dendrotrophe polyneura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying properties."
