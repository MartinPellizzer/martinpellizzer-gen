    "intro": "Dendrokingstonia nervosa, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves with finely divided veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
