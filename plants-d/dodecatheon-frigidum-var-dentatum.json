    "intro": "Dodecatheon frigidum var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed glory-of-the-snow, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with distinctive toothed margins, which give the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
