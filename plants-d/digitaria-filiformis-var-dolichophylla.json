    "intro": "Digitaria filiformis var. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf digitaria, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
