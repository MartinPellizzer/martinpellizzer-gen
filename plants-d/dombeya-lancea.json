    "intro": "Dombeya lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf dombeya, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shrubland and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance. Dombeya lancea is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
