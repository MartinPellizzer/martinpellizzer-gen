    "intro": "Dryopteris stegnogramme var. asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the stegnogramme wood fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
