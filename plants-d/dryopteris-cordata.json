    "intro": "Dryopteris cordata, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, bilobed fronds that are often adorned with a pale midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its durable, attractive foliage."
