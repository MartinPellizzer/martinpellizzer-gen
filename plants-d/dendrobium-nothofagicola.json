    "intro": "Dendrobium nothofagicola, commonly known as the Nothofagus orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the subtropical rainforests of South America. It grows on the trunks and branches of Nothofagus trees, forming a unique ecological relationship with its host. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with long, segmented stems that often bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to withstand the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
