    "intro": "Delphinium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple, spurred flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Delphinium calcicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
