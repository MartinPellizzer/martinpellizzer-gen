    "intro": "Dendrophorbium floribundum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in a fine, white down. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Dendrophorbium floribundum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
