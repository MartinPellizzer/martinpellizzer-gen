    "intro": "Dalea myriadenia, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Dalea myriadenia is also valued for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in arid ecosystems."
