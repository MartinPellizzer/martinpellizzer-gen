    "intro": "Dichaea lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's dichaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the humid environment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or green, and are borne on short, erect stalks. Dichaea lehmannii thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat."
