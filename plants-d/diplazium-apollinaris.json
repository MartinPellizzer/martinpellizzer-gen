    "intro": "Diplazium apollinaris, commonly known as the Apollinaris fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies. Diplazium apollinaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
