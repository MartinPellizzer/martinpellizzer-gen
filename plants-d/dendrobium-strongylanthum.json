    "intro": "Dendrobium strongylanthum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that attracts pollinators. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Dendrobium strongylanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
