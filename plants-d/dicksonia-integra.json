    "intro": "Dicksonia integra, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged fronds that give it a unique, elegant appearance. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the plant's growth and enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dicksonia integra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
