    "intro": "Drymaria veliziae, commonly known as the velvet sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Drymaria veliziae is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
