    "intro": "Diplazium arboreum var. otites, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
