    "intro": "Daphniphyllum longipes, commonly known as the Chinese holly or evergreen laurel, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
