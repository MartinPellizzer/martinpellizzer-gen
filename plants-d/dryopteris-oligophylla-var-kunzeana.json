    "intro": "Dryopteris oligophylla var. kunzeana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically 40\u201360 cm in length, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are a notable feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
