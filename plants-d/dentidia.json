    "intro": "Dentidia, commonly known as the \"toothed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Dentidia species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. They have a fibrous root system and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil. The name \"Dentidia\" refers to the tooth-like structures on the edges of their leaves, which aid in water retention and defense against herbivores."
