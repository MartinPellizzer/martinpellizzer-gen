    "intro": "Dianthus carthusianorum subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf carnation, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The leaves are typically broad and fleshy, which helps the plant conserve water in its arid habitat. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
