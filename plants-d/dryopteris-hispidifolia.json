    "intro": "Dryopteris hispidifolia, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
