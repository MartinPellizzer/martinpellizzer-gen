It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
