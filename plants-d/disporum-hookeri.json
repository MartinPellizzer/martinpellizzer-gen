    "intro": "Disporum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's disporum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in spring. Disporum hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
