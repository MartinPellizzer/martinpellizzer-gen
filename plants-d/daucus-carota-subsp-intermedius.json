    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate carrot, is a wild relative of the domesticated carrot. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces umbels of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are generally smaller and less fleshy compared to those of cultivated carrots. This subspecies is valued for its potential in plant breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
