    "intro": "Daviesia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered daviesia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, pink to red flowers during the autumn season, which attract a variety of pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Daviesia parvifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal conditions."
