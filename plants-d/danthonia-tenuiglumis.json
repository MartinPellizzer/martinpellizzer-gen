It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Danthonia tenuiglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
