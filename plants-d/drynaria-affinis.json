    "intro": "Drynaria affinis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive sword-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy underground stem that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Drynaria affinis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests."
