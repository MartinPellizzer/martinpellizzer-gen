    "intro": "Dianthus attenuatus var. sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand dianthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or red flowers with prominent central stamens. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens and rockeries."
