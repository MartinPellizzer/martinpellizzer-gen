    "intro": "Drosera derbyensis, commonly known as the Derby Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
