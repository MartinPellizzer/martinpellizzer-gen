    "intro": "Dendrophthora cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks and branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale green leaves and striking white, waxy flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is closely monitored by conservationists."
