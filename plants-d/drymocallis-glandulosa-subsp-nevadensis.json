It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have glandular dots, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
