    "intro": "Dendrobium glossorhynchoides, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive lip that is often orange or red. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
