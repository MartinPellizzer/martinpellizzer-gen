    "intro": "Delphinium nudicaule var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on both sides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a striking yet relatively low-maintenance perennial. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic to humans and animals."
