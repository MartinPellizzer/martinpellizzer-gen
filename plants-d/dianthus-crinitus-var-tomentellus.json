    "intro": "Dianthus crinitus var. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly cushion campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, pink or magenta flowers that bloom in early summer. The foliage consists of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky garden settings."
