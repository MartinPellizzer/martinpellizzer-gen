    "intro": "Draba mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in Mongolia, China, and Russia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Draba mongolica is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural and reproductive features."
