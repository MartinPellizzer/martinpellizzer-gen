It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
