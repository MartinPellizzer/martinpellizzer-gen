    "intro": "Diplectria nodosa, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features closely spaced, elongated leaves that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on short, erect stalks and contain spores for dispersal. This species is typically found in rocky crevices or on the soil surface in temperate regions."
