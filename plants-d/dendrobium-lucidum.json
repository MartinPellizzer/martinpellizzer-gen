    "intro": "Dendrobium lucidum, commonly known as the shining orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium lucidum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and long-lasting blooms."
