    "intro": "Dendrobium limpidum subsp. daunceyae, commonly known as the Dauncey's Dendrobium, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants rather than in soil. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
