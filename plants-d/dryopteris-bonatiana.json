    "intro": "Dryopteris bonatiana, commonly known as the Bonati's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
