    "intro": "Dryopteris heteroclita, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that varies in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and forest floors, where it can form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Dryopteris heteroclita plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
