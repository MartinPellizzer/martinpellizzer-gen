    "intro": "Diplazium stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
