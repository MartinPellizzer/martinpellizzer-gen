    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 occulta, commonly known as the hidden wood fern, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris pentaphylla. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris \u00d7 occulta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
