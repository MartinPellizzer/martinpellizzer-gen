    "intro": "Diploma hudsonica, commonly known as the Hudson's Bay diploma plant, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, dark berries that are a food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
