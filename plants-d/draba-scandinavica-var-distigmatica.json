It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in high-altitude environments."
