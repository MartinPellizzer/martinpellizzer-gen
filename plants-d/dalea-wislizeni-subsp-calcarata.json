    "intro": "Dalea wislizeni subsp. calcarata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The subspecies calcarata is distinguished by its distinctive leaf base that forms a small, calcareous (lime-rich) structure, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil."
