    "intro": "Delphinium halteratum var. venulosum, commonly known as the veined larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of spurred, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive veining pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. However, all parts of the plant are toxic, requiring caution during handling and cultivation."
