    "intro": "Dryopteris reticulata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in both garden and natural settings."
