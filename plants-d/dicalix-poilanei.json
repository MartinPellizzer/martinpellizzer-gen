    "intro": "Dicalix poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's dicalix, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dicalix poilanei is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
