    "intro": "Diplazium velaminosum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves."
