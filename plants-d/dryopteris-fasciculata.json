    "intro": "Dryopteris fasciculata, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fern is noted for its ornamental value and is often used in garden landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
