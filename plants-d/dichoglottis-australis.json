    "intro": "Dichoglottis australis, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves that are often used for weaving traditional M\u0101ori basketry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Dichoglottis australis is valued not only for its cultural significance but also for its ornamental and practical uses in horticulture."
