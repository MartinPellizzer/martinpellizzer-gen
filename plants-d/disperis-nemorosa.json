    "intro": "Disperis nemorosa, commonly known as the forest disperis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest margins. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
