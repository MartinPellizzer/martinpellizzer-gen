    "intro": "Drosera stricticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Drosera stricticaulis is a hardy plant that can survive in harsh conditions, making it a unique example of adaptive flora in its habitat."
