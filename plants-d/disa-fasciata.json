    "intro": "Disa fasciata, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's coat, and its tall, upright flower spikes that bear clusters of bright yellow and green flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often flowering after rainfall. Disa fasciata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
