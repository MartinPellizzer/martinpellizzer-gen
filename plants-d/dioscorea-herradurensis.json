    "intro": "Dioscorea herradurensis, commonly known as the Mexican yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its tubers are similar in appearance to other yam species but are less commonly cultivated for food. The botanical features of D. herradurensis make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
