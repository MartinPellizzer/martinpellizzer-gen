    "intro": "Daphne calycina, commonly known as the Christmas daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that bloom in winter, typically in shades of white, pink, and lilac. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals, requiring caution when handling."
