    "intro": "Dryopteris takeoi, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It features a compact, dense foliage with leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into shield-shaped pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a brown indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
