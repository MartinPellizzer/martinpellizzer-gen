    "intro": "Daphne viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring. Daphne viridiflora is known for its strong, fragrant scent, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
