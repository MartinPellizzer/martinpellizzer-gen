    "intro": "Dendrobium albiviride var. minor, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, tropical climates, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate veining that gives it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
