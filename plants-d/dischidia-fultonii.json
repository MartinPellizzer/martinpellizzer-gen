    "intro": "Dischidia fultonii, commonly known as the Fulton's bubble vine, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, inflated stem segments that resemble bubbles, which aid in water storage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, followed by berries that are typically red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant in many regions."
