    "intro": "Dryas octopetala f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous dryas, is a flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitats. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth form and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
