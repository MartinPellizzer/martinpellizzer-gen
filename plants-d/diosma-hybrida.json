    "intro": "Diosma hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid diosma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid regions. Diosma hybrida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
