    "intro": "Digitaria ciliaris var. chrysoblephara, commonly known as golden finger grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue along the edges, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
