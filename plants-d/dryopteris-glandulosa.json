    "intro": "Dryopteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
