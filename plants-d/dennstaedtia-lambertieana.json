    "intro": "Dennstaedtia lambertieana, commonly known as the Lambert's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color."
