    "intro": "Dolichostegia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves, which are often broad and pinnately arranged. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive papilionaceous structure. Dolichostegia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia. These plants are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
