    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 microcarpa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or yellow flowers. Native to alpine and arctic regions, it thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low light conditions. The plant is perennial and exhibits a short growing season, often flowering in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize remote and harsh habitats."
