    "intro": "Dennstaedtia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in rich, humusy soil. The smooth fern is a hardy plant that plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
