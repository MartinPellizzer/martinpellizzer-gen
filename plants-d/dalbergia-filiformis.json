    "intro": "Dalbergia filiformis, commonly known as the slender legume, is a small, shrub-like leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
