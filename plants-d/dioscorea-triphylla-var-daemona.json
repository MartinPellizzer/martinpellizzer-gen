It features striking, warty tubers that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Its unique morphology and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical studies. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
