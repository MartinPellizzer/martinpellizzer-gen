    "intro": "Draba verna var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a raceme, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Draba verna."
