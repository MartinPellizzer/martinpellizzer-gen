    "intro": "Davallia pullei, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a silvery or pale green coating. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters over time. Davallia pullei is valued for its ornamental appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
