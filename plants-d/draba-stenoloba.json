    "intro": "Draba stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Draba stenoloba is valued for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes."
