    "intro": "Daphniphyllum glaucescens var. iriomotense, commonly known as the Iriomote holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
