    "intro": "Dryopteris diacalpioides, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
