    "intro": "Dalbergia maymyensis var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam rosewood, is a tropical hardwood species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a high oil content. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and its flowers are typically small and clustered. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
