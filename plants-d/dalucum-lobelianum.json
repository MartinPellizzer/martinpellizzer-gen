    "intro": "Dalucum lobelianum, commonly known as the bluebells of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Dalucum lobelianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
