It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
