    "intro": "Dactylostemon australis, commonly known as the Australian bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its distinctive swollen trunk, which stores water for drought survival. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Dactylostemon australis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for landscaping in dry climates."
