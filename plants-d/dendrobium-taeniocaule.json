    "intro": "Dendrobium taeniocaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dendrobium taeniocaule thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
