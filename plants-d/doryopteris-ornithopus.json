    "intro": "Doryopteris ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's foot fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a bird's foot, with multiple small, clustered pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Doryopteris ornithopus is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its role in traditional medicine."
