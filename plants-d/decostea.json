    "intro": "Decostea, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of about 10 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Decostea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
