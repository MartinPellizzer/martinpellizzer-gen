    "intro": "Dyctisperma rigidus, commonly known as the rigid flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are rigid and somewhat leathery in texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. Dyctisperma rigidus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
