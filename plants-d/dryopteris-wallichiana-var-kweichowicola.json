    "intro": "Dryopteris wallichiana var. kweichowicola, commonly known as the Kweichow wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
