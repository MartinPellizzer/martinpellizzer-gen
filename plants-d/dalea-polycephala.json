It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Dalea polycephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
