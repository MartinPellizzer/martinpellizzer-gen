    "intro": "Dendrobium archipelagense, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces light yellow to white blooms with a distinctive greenish throat, which are usually clustered along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
