    "intro": "Dryopteris canadasii, commonly known as the Canadian lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30\u201390 cm long, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are edible when young and tender. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are dark green and turn a bronze color in the fall before dying back."
