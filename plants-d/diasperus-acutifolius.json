    "intro": "Diasperus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features spiny, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Diasperus acutifolius is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
