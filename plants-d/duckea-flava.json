    "intro": "Duckea flava, commonly known as the yellow duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Duckea flava is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to significant ecological impacts if left unchecked. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to aquatic ecosystems and plant biology."
