    "intro": "Dryopteris adenophora, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its distinctive hairy appearance, particularly on the stems and young fronds, is a key identifying feature."
