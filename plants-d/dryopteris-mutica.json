    "intro": "Dryopteris mutica, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Dryopteris mutica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
