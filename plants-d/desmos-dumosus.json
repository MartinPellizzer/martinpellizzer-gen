    "intro": "Desmos dumosus, commonly known as the dwarf desmos or rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
