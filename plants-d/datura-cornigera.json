    "intro": "Datura cornigera, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a member of the nightshade family. Datura cornigera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and dry fields. Its rapid growth and potent alkaloids make it both ecologically significant and potentially dangerous to livestock and humans."
