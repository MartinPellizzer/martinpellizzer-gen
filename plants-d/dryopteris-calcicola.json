    "intro": "Dryopteris calcicola, commonly known as the limestone wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a deeply divided, bi- or tri-pinnate pattern. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in a distinctive pattern. This fern is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
