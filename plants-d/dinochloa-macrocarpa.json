    "intro": "Dinochloa macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating fronds. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are typically broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen. However, it can become invasive in non-native waters, disrupting local biodiversity."
