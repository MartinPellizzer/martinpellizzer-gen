    "intro": "Dyckia ctenophylla, commonly known as the hairy dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which features long, fibrous leaves that give it a distinctive, hairy appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast sharply with its green foliage. It is a perennial plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dyckia ctenophylla is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand high temperatures."
