    "intro": "Desmanthus insularis, commonly known as the Bahama dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It has adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Desmanthus insularis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
