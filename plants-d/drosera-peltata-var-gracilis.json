    "intro": "Drosera peltata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, sticky tentacles that secrete a mucilaginous substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in boggy or wetland habitats, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a dense covering of glandular hairs. This variety is prized by botanists and collectors for its unique appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition."
