    "intro": "Dryopteris christii, commonly known as the Christ's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
