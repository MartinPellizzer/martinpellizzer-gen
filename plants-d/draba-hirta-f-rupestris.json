    "intro": "Draba hirta f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, white flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually basal and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Draba hirta f. rupestris is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
