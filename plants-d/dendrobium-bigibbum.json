    "intro": "Dendrobium bigibbum, commonly known as the orchid with the most flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on air and rain for moisture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Dendrobium bigibbum is popular among orchid growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
