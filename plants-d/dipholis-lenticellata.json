    "intro": "Dipholis lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in Africa. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. The plant has thin, flexible stems that can float or root in submerged substrates. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are specialized organs for capturing prey. This species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize and supplement its nutrient intake through its unique trapping mechanism."
