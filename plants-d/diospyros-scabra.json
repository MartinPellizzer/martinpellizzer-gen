    "intro": "Diospyros scabra, commonly known as rough-shelled ebony, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into small, round fruits with a smooth, leathery skin. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. It is valued for its hard, dark wood and is often found in tropical lowland forests."
