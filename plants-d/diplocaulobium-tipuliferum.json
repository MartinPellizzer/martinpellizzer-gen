It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, contributing to its overall grass-like appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
