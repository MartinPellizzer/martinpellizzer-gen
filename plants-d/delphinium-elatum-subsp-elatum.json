    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. elatum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, bearing clusters of spurred blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
