It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
