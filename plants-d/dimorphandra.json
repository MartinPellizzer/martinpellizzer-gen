    "intro": "Dimorphandra, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Africa and includes several species, such as Dimorphandra glabra, which is widely used in traditional medicine. The plant is characterized by its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Dimorphandra species typically have bipinnate leaves and produce yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. These plants are often found in dry, tropical, and subtropical regions, where they play an important ecological role."
