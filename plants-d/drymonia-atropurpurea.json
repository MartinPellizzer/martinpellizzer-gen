It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native plant supporting local ecosystems and its ornamental value in gardens."
