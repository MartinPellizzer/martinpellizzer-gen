    "intro": "Dipsacus azureus, commonly known as the blue teasel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and distinctive blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves and produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
