    "intro": "Dalea ayavacensis var. viridescens, commonly known as the greenleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its common name. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
