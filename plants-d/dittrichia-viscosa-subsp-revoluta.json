    "intro": "Dittrichia viscosa subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the sticky dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by a pappus of bristles, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its resinous properties make it an interesting subject for ecological and chemical studies."
