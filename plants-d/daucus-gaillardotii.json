    "intro": "Daucus gaillardotii, commonly known as the Mexican cow parsnip, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are not typically cultivated for food but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Daucus gaillardotii thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides."
