    "intro": "Dalbergia manongarivensis, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has pinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, elongated seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions of Madagascar. Due to overharvesting, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List."
