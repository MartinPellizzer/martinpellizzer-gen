    "intro": "Dissotis brazzae, commonly known as the Brazza's spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Dissotis brazzae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
