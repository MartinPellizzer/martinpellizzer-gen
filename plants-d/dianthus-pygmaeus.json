    "intro": "Dianthus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf carnation, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, pinkish-red or white flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Dianthus pygmaeus is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established."
