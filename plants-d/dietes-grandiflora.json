    "intro": "Dietes grandiflora, commonly known as the African daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's fibrous roots help stabilize soil, and it is often used in traditional medicine."
