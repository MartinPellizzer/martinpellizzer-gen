    "intro": "Danthonia triticoides, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and forested wetlands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments. Danthonia triticoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in water-saturated soils."
