    "intro": "Davallia pulchra, commonly known as the \"lucky bamboo,\" is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid environments and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Davallia pulchra is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its air-purifying qualities."
