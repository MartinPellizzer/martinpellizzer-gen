    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. cryophilum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture. This subspecies is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
