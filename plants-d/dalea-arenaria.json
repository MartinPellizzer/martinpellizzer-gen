    "intro": "Dalea arenaria, commonly known as sandblain or sand-plain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Dalea arenaria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
