    "intro": "Drosera montana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its leaves are covered in sticky glands that trap insects. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
