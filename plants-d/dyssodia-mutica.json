    "intro": "Dyssodia mutica, commonly known as the rough dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in compact clusters, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Dyssodia mutica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
