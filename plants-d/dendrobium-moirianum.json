    "intro": "Dendrobium moirianum, commonly known as the Moir's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients. Dendrobium moirianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
