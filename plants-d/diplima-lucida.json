It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, contributing to its glossy appearance. Diplima lucida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
