    "intro": "Dorycnium sabaudum, commonly known as the Sabaudian burr or Sabaudian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Dorycnium sabaudum is known for its ability to spread through its persistent, seed-containing burrs that cling to animal fur and clothing."
