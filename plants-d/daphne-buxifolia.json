    "intro": "Daphne buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage consisting of small, leathery, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
