    "intro": "Dryopteris sagenioides subsp. obscura, commonly known as the dark fern, is a shade-loving fern native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, almost black appearance when dry. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, typical of the fern family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
