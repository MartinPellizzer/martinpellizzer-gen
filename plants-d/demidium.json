It is native to various regions in Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which often have a distinctive three-lobed lip. Demidium species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. These plants require bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
