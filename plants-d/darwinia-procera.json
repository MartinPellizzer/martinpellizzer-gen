    "intro": "Darwinia procera, commonly known as the tall devil's bit, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a hairy texture, and they are arranged in a basal rosette. Darwinia procera blooms during spring and summer, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators such as birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
