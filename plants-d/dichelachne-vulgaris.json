    "intro": "Dichelachne vulgaris, commonly known as common dichelachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense stands, which can impact local ecosystems and agricultural lands."
