    "intro": "Dryopteris crassirhizoma f. maackii, commonly known as the Maack's shield fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
