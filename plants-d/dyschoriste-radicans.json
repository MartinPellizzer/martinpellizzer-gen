    "intro": "Dyschoriste radicans, commonly known as creeping dyschoriste, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
