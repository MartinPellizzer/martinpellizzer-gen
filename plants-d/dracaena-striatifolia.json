    "intro": "Dracaena striatifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are marked with striking white and green vertical stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Dracaena striatifolia is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests, contributing to its popularity as a houseplant."
