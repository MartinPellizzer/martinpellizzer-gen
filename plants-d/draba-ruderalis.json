    "intro": "Draba ruderalis, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a small flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its ability to colonize open, nutrient-poor environments. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Draba ruderalis is an important pioneer species in ecological succession, often being one of the first plants to establish in newly disturbed habitats."
