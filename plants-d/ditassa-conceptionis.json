    "intro": "Ditassa conceptionis, commonly known as the celestial bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
