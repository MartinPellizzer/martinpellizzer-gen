    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 complexa subsp. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian wood fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, serrated margin and a dark green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction."
