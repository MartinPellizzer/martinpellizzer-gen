    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa f. schiedeana, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
