    "intro": "Dryopteris millei, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a golden tomentum on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae that produce sporangia on the underside. Dryopteris millei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
