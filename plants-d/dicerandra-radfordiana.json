    "intro": "Dicerandra radfordiana, commonly known as Radford's dicerandra, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Florida. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
