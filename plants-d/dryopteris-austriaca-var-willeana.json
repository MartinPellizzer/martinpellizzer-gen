    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca var. willeana, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a variant of the Austrian wood fern native to Central Europe. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
