    "intro": "Dryopteris silviensis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Dryopteris silviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
