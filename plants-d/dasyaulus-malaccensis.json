    "intro": "Dasyaulus malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca dasyaulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found growing as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest in botanical research for its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
