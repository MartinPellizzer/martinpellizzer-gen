    "intro": "Dendrobium ceraceum, commonly known as the wax orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to maximize sunlight absorption. Dendrobium ceraceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
