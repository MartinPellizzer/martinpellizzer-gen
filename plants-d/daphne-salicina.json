    "intro": "Daphne salicina, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Daphne salicina is valued in gardens for its winter interest and showy spring blooms."
