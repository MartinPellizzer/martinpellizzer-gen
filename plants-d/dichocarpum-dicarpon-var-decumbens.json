    "intro": "Dichocarpum dicarpon var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping twinflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems lie close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is notable for its adaptability to cool, moist conditions and its role in ecological succession in forested areas."
