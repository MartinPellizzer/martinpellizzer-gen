    "intro": "Distichlis spicata var. marginata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted clusters of small, spikelike flowers. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dune environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions."
