    "intro": "Dracophyllum ophioliticum, commonly known as the ophiolite draco, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
