    "intro": "Diplazium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features fronds that are typically pinnate, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
