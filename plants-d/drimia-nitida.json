It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Drimia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
