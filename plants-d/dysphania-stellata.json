    "intro": "Dysphania stellata, commonly known as creeping lamb's-quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are pale green to yellow, arranged in clusters. Dysphania stellata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also used in some traditional herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties."
