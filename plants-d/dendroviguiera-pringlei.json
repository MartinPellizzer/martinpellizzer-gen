    "intro": "Dendroviguiera pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's dendroviguiera, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at high elevations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
