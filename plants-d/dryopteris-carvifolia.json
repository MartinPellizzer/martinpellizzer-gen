    "intro": "Dryopteris carvifolia, commonly known as the Carved Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides."
