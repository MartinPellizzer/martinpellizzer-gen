It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that is often drooping or spreading. Dichanthelium perlongum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
