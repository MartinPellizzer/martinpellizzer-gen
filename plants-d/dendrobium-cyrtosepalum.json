It features a sympodial growth habit with cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with narrow, pointed sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
