    "intro": "Dendrobium molle, commonly known as the soft dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of soft, velvety tissue. Dendrobium molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
