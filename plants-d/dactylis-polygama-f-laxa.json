    "intro": "Dactylis polygama f. laxa, commonly known as the loose-stemmed cat's ear, is a variant of the cat's ear grass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often mistaken for dandelion flowers. Its loose, sprawling growth habit allows it to spread easily in grasslands and meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
