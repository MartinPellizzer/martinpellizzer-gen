    "intro": "Dryopteris viscidula, commonly known as the sticky wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
