    "intro": "Dalbergia ferrugineotomentosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves with a hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
