    "intro": "Diphasium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight sheen, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Diphasium decurrens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
