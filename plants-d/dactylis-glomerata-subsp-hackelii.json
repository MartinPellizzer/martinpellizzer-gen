    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata subsp. hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in open panicles. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in forage and erosion control."
