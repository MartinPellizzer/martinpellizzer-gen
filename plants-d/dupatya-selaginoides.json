    "intro": "Dupatya selaginoides, commonly known as the silver-leaved forest fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among dense undergrowth. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, toothed segments that contribute to its ornamental value. Dupatya selaginoides plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various insect species."
