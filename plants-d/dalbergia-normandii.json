    "intro": "Dalbergia normandii, commonly known as the Normandy rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often covered with fine hairs. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, flat pods containing seeds. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, Dalbergia normandii is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
