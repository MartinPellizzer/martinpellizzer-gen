    "intro": "Drymoglossum wiesbaurii, commonly known as the Wiesbaur's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows on damp, shaded rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a delicate, dark green appearance with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in length. It lacks true stems and roots, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. This moss is often found in moist, humid environments and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
