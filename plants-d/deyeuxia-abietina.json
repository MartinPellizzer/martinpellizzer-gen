    "intro": "Deyeuxia abietina, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Deyeuxia abietina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
