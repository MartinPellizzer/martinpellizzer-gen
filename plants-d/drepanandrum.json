    "intro": "Drepanandrum, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
