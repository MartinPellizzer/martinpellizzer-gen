It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
