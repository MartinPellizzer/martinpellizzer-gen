    "intro": "Desmodium triflorum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf ticktrefoil, is a small, perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
