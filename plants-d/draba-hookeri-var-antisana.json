    "intro": "Draba hookeri var. antisana, commonly known as the Antisana whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Draba hookeri var. antisana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
