    "intro": "Dryopteris bivestita, commonly known as the two-cloth fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are densely covered with small, scale-like structures on both sides, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
