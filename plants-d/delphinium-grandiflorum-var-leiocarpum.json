    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the blue delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, forming a basal rosette and alternate along the stem. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It is a popular choice for gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
