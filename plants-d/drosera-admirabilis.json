    "intro": "Drosera admirabilis, commonly known as the marvel pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hirsute, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces tall, inflorescent stems with clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
