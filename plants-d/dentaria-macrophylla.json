    "intro": "Dentaria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a raceme during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
