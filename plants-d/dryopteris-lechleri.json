    "intro": "Dryopteris lechleri, commonly known as the *sangre de drago* or dragon's blood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green to reddish-brown coloration. The plant is notable for its ability to secrete a red, resinous substance known as dragon's blood, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and historical significance make it a subject of both botanical and cultural interest."
