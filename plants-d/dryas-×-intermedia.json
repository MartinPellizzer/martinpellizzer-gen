    "intro": "Dryas \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Dryas octopetala and Dryas drummondii. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Dryas \u00d7 intermedia is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes across the northern hemisphere."
