    "intro": "Dryopteris austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late summer months."
