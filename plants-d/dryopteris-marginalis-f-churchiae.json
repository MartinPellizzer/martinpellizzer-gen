    "intro": "Dryopteris marginalis f. churchiae, commonly known as the Church's marginal wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive marginal pinnae that are often curled or twisted. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
