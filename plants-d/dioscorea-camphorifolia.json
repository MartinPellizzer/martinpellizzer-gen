    "intro": "Dioscorea camphorifolia, commonly known as the camphorleaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit involves twining stems that ascend support structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of D. camphorifolia make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and medicinal studies."
