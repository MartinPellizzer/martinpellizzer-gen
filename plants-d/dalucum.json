    "intro": "Dalucum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and rivers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment, contributing to the ecosystem's health. Dalucum is revered in local cultures for its beauty and symbolic significance."
