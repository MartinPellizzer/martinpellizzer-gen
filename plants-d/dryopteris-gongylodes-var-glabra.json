    "intro": "Dryopteris gongylodes var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are smooth and glossy, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
