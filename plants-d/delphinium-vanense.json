    "intro": "Delphinium vanense, commonly known as the Vanes' larkspur, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes and bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. Delphinium vanense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock."
