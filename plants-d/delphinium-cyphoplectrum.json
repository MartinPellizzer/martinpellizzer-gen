It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a coarse texture and a bluish-green hue. Delphinium cyphoplectrum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats."
