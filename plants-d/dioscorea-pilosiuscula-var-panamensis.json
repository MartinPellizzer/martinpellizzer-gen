It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used as food in some regions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex network of runners that help it spread across the forest floor. The tubers are often harvested for their starchy, edible contents."
