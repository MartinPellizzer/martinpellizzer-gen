    "intro": "Delosperma asperulum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow, typically blooming in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Delosperma asperulum is also known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
