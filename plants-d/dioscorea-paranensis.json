    "intro": "Dioscorea paranensis, commonly known as the Paran\u00e1 yam, is a perennial vine native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, though they are not as widely cultivated as other yam species. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories."
