    "intro": "Dryopteris multisora, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments resembling shields. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside."
