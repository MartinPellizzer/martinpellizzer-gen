    "intro": "Dicrocaulon nodosum, commonly known as the knotted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with short, branching stems that help it float or remain anchored. Dicrocaulon nodosum is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
