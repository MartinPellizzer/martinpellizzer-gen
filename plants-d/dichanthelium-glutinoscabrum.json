    "intro": "Dichanthelium glutinoscabrum, commonly known as sticky scabrous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, stiff leaves and spikelets that are often tinged with purple. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of slender, raceme-like clusters of small, two-flowered spikelets. Dichanthelium glutinoscabrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
