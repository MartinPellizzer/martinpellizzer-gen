    "intro": "Dipsacus sylvestris subsp. fullonum, commonly known as the bristly teasel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique bracts, which are modified leaves, enclose the flower heads and give it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in textile production."
