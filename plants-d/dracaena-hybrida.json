    "intro": "Dracaena hybrida, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Dracaena hybrida is also valued for its resilience and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
