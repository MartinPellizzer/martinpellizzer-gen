    "intro": "Dendrobium strebloceras var. rossianum, commonly known as the Rossian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal droughts. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
