    "intro": "Dryopteris oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 1 to 3 feet long. The fronds are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
