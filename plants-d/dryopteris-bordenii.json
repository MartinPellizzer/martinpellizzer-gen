    "intro": "Dryopteris bordenii, commonly known as the Borden's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into a series of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
