    "intro": "Dasygrammitis, commonly known as the hard fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tough, leathery fronds that are adapted to survive in dry or shaded environments. Dasygrammitis species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce clustered leaves. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a distinctive appearance that varies among species. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or in moist, shaded areas."
