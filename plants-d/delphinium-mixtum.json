    "intro": "Delphinium mixtum, commonly known as the hybrid delphinium, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Delphinium mixtum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can grow up to 6 feet in height."
