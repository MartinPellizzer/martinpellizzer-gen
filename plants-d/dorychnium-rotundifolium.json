    "intro": "Dorychnium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a robust, hairy stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its spiny, bur-like fruit, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Dorychnium rotundifolium is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
