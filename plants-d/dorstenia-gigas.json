    "intro": "Dorstenia gigas, commonly known as the giant false arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a single flower but is actually a cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a spadix and a spathe. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Dorstenia gigas is also noted for its unique ability to store water in its stem, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established."
