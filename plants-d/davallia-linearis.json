    "intro": "Davallia linearis, commonly known as the linear holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new plants at the nodes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, needle-like pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
