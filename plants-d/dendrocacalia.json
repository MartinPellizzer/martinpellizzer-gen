    "intro": "Dendrocacalia, commonly known as the \"forest bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their climbing or shrub-like growth habit, often featuring attractive, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The leaves are typically opposite and have a velvety texture, while the stems are often woody and can bear tendrils for support. Dendrocacalia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental flowers and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
