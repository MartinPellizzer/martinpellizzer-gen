It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged along the stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
