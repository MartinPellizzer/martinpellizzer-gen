    "intro": "Dioscorea monadelpha var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca yam, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often using tendrils to support its growth. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. The tubers of this species are valued for their starchy content and have been used in traditional cuisines and medicinal practices."
