    "intro": "Diplazium polyanthes, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, which contribute to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
