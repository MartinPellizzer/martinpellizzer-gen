    "intro": "Dipsacus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple tepee, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, though it is not closely related to them. Dipsacus atropurpureus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
