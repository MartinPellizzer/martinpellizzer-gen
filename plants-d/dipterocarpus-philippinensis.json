It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its buttressed roots and tall, straight trunk. The tree produces large, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril. It thrives in lowland tropical rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of these ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
