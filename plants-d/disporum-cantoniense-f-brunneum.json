    "intro": "Disporum cantoniense f. brunneum, commonly known as the brown-flowered disporum, is a rare variant of the disporum species native to southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-brown flowers that differ from the typical white or green hues of the species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
