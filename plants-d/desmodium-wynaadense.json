It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
