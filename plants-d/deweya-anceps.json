    "intro": "Deweya anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Deweya anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
