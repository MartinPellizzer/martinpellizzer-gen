    "intro": "Drosera quartzicola, commonly known as the quartz leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the quartz-rich environments of South Africa. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, which are then digested to supplement the plant's nutrient intake. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on quartz outcrops where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are elongated and covered in bright red or orange secretory glands, which give it a striking appearance. Drosera quartzicola is a small plant, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it a unique and delicate member of the Droseraceae family."
