    "intro": "Dendrobium montanum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in rocky or mountainous environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Dendrobium montanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
