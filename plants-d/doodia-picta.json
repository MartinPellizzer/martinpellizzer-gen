    "intro": "Doodia picta, commonly known as the painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking pattern of light and dark green. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Doodia picta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where it can thrive in partial shade."
