    "intro": "Diplazium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a distinctive, broad, and leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The fronds are divided into segments with a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
