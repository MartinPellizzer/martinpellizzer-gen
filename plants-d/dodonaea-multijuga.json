    "intro": "Dodonaea multijuga, commonly known as the silverleaf glorybower, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
