    "intro": "Draconia campestris subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky dragon's beard, is a perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on the leaves, which give it its common name and help deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
