    "intro": "Dendroarabis, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, often spiny leaves and clusters of yellow or white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from underground sources. Dendroarabis species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
