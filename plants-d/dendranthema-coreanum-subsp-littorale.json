    "intro": "Dendranthema coreanum subsp. littorale, commonly known as the coastal chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Korea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand salty air and wind. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens and rockeries. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping to stabilize sandy or rocky soils along shorelines."
