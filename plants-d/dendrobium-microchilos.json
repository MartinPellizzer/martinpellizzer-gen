    "intro": "Dendrobium microchilos, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
