    "intro": "Decussocarpus fleuryi, commonly known as the Fleury's decussocarp, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive decussate (crossed) arrangement of its fruiting bodies, which are typically small and clustered. The plant belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical tree species. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a preference for humid, shaded environments in tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
