    "intro": "Donacodes rosea, commonly known as the pink spike rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or pinkish in color, giving it its common name. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in tight, spike-like clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Donacodes rosea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
