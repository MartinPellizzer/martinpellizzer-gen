    "intro": "Disporum pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered disporum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist soils. Disporum pedunculatum is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
