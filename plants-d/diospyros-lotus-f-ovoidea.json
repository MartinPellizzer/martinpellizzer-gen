    "intro": "Diospyros lotus f. ovoidea, commonly known as the Persian date plum, is a unique variant of the date plum tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive egg-shaped fruit, which is typically smaller and more elongated than the standard fruit of the species. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, showing remarkable drought tolerance due to its deep root system. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. The fruit, though less commonly cultivated than the standard variety, is valued for its sweet, aromatic pulp and historical significance in traditional medicine."
