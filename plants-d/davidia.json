    "intro": "Davidia, commonly known as the handkerchief tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its unique, feathery seed pods that resemble white handkerchiefs, which give it its common name. The tree produces striking white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by the distinctive seed structures. Davidia is a member of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae) and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge."
