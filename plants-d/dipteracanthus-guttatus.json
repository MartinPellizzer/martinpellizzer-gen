    "intro": "Dipteracanthus guttatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae, which includes many tropical tree species. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found near streams or in moist, shaded areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
