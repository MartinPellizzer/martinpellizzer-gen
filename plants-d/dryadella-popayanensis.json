It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence.

This species is often found in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
