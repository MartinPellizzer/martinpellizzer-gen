    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cornuta, commonly known as the horned fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that bear clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in various humid habitats."
