    "intro": "Draba corsica, commonly known as the Corsican rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring months. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs. Draba corsica is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude areas."
