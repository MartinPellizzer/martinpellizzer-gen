    "intro": "Duranta plumieri var. vestita, commonly known as the silver duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its clusters of blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The varietal form 'vestita' distinguishes it from other duranta species by its unique leaf coloration."
