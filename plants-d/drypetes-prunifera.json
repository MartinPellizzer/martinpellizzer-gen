    "intro": "Drypetes prunifera, commonly known as the roseapple tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp surrounding a central core of seeds, making it a valuable fruit in tropical regions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
