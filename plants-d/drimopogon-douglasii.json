    "intro": "Drimopogon douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's drimopogon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
