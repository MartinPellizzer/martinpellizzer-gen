    "intro": "Dryopteris doniana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
