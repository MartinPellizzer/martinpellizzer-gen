    "intro": "Dudleya guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it receives minimal soil and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, appearing in clusters during the spring or early summer. Dudleya guadalupensis is a slow-growing perennial, prized for its resilience and unique appearance in rock gardens."
