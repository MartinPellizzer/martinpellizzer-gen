    "intro": "Daemonorops ruptilis var. acaulescens, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
