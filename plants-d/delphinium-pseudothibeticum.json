    "intro": "Delphinium pseudothibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Delphinium pseudothibeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
