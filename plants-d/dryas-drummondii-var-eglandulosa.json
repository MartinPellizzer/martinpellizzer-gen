    "intro": "Dryas drummondii var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often used as an indicator species in alpine ecosystems."
