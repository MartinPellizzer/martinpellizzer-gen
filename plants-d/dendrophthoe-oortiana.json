    "intro": "Dendrophthoe oortiana, commonly known as the Oort's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often dispersed by birds. It forms dense clusters on its host, potentially affecting the host's growth and health. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is of interest in studies of plant parasitism and biodiversity."
