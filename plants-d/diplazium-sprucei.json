    "intro": "Diplazium sprucei, commonly known as the spruce fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
