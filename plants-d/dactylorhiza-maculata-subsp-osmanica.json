    "intro": "Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. osmanica, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a single, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is known for its distinctive spotted leaves and is considered a valuable indicator of nutrient-poor soils."
