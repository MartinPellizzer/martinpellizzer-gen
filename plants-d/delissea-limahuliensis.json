    "intro": "Delissea limahuliensis, commonly known as the Limahuli daisy, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for studying island biodiversity and ecological adaptation."
