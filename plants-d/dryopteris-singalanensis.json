    "intro": "Dryopteris singalanensis, commonly known as the Singalana shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or forested substrates."
