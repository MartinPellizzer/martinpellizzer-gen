    "intro": "Digraphis arundinacea f. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a variant of the common reed characterized by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of water bodies. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often greenish or reddish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other reed species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth form."
