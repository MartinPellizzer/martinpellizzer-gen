    "intro": "Dipcadi stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
