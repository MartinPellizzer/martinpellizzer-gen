    "intro": "Dichaea wercklei, commonly known as the Werckle's moss, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are borne on short, erect stems. Dichaea wercklei is often grown as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
