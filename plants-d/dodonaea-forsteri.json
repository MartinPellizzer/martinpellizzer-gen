    "intro": "Dodonaea forsteri, commonly known as the coastal hop bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, bright green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Dodonaea forsteri plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
