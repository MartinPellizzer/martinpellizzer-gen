    "intro": "Dioscorea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yam, is a small, herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its tubers, though not as economically important as those of other yam species, are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and medicinal botany."
