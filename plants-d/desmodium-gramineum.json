    "intro": "Desmodium gramineum, commonly known as slender desmodium, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Desmodium gramineum is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
