    "intro": "Dichorisandra variegata, commonly known as the variegated dichorisandra, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, which adds a dramatic visual appeal to gardens. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange or red tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
