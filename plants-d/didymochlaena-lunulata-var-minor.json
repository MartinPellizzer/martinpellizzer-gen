    "intro": "Didymochlaena lunulata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser moon-leaf, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that resemble delicate lace, giving it a unique aesthetic. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
