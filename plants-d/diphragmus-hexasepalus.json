It is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive six-lobed sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
