    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcopodioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
