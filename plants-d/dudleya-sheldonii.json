    "intro": "Dudleya sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, evergreen leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
