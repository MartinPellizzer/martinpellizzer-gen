    "intro": "Deparia dickasonii, commonly known as the Dickason's wood fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces primarily through sexual reproduction, although it can also spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Deparia dickasonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
