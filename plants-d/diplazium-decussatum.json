    "intro": "Diplazium decussatum, commonly known as the cross-stemmed water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae arranged in a cross-like pattern on either side of the midrib. Diplazium decussatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
