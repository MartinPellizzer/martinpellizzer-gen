    "intro": "Dendrobium aurantiacum var. denneanum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple stems that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
