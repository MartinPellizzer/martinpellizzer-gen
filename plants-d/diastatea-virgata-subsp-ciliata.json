    "intro": "Diastatea virgata subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. The subspecies ciliata is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its ornamental value in aquatic and wetland gardens."
