    "intro": "Dryopteris notabilis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
