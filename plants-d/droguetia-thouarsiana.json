    "intro": "Droguetia thouarsiana, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Madagascar, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the island nation. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a distinctive red throat. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often floating on the water's surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments. Droguetia thouarsiana is also noted for its cultural significance among the indigenous Malagasy people."
