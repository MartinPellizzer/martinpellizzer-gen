    "intro": "Disa schizodioides, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a striking South African orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators. Disa schizodioides is often found in rocky outcrops and open grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
