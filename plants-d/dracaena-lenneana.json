    "intro": "Dracaena lenneana, commonly known as the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are dark green with striking red or orange margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena lenneana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
