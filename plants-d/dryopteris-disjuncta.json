    "intro": "Dryopteris disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two distinct sections, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and short, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
