    "intro": "Daucus carota var. meriensis, commonly known as the Meriense carrot, is a rare variant of the wild carrot. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are finely divided and resemble those of the common carrot, with a delicate, aromatic scent. This variety is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for horticultural use."
