    "intro": "Dracophilus dealbatus, commonly known as the white-flowered dracophilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
