    "intro": "Didymonema, commonly known as the common false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of a single species, Didymonema pulchellum, which is native to South America. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive shape, while the flowers produce small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
