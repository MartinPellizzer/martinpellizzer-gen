    "intro": "Dipsacus sylvestris, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a beard, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. Dipsacus sylvestris is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
