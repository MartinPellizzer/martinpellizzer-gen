    "intro": "Dichanthelium aculeatum, commonly known as the prickly panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often bristly or hairy. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a slightly rough texture. Dichanthelium aculeatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
