    "intro": "Diospyros kaki var. costata, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon, is a variant of the common persimmon native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed or costate fruit skin, which gives it its scientific name. The fruit is typically sweet and honey-like when fully ripe, with a high moisture content and a soft, non-astringent texture. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
