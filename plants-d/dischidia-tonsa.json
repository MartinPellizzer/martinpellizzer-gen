    "intro": "Dischidia tonsa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, warm climates. Dischidia tonsa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
