    "intro": "Dalea ramosissima, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. Dalea ramosissima is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
