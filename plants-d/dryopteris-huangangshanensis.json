    "intro": "Dryopteris huangangshanensis, commonly known as the Huanggangshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a broad, shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
