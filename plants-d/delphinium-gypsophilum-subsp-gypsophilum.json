The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and delicate beauty, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
