    "intro": "Dryopteris leiboensis, commonly known as the Leibo's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
