    "intro": "Dennstaedtia straminea, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through rhizome growth. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips."
