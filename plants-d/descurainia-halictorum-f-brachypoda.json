    "intro": "Descurainia halictorum f. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed wallflower, is a variant of the yellow wallflower species. It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in dry, sunny areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in racemes. This form is notable for its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Descurainia halictorum."
