    "intro": "Dischidia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal dischidia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid and coastal habitat. Dischidia litoralis is a popular houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
