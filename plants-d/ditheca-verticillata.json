It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant. The flowers are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind pollination."
