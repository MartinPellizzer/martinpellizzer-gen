    "intro": "Daucus boissieui, commonly known as the Boissieu carrot, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are typically small and not as economically significant as those of the common carrot. Daucus boissieui is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
