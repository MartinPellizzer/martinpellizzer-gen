It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Dalea stanfieldii is often found in open habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
