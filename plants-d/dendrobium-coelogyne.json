    "intro": "Dendrobium coelogyne, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its tall, cane-like stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Its blooms are often adorned with intricate patterns and are highly sought after in horticulture. Dendrobium coelogyne is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Asian medicine."
