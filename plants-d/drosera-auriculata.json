    "intro": "Drosera auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish in color and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) shape at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in sandy or peaty soils. Drosera auriculata is a low-growing plant that produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months."
