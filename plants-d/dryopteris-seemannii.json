    "intro": "Dryopteris seemannii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the fall, but the rhizomes remain evergreen, ensuring the plant's survival through seasonal changes."
