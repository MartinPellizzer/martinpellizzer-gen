    "intro": "Disporum ovale f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered death camas, is a variant of the death camas plant characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is closely related to other toxic plants in the genus Disporum. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
