    "intro": "Dryopteris clintoniana var. atropalustris, commonly known as the black marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland environments in North America. It features dark, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining wetland ecosystems."
