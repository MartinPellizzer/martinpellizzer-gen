    "intro": "Diplazium tarapotense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous erect, slender fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Diplazium tarapotense is native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance."
