It is characterized by its large, palmately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
