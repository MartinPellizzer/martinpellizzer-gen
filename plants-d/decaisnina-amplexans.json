    "intro": "Decaisnina amplexans, commonly known as the climbing fig-leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often curl around supporting structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it popular in ornamental horticulture. However, it requires a humid climate and well-drained soil to thrive."
