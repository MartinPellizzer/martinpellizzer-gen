    "intro": "Drejerella calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in calcareous environments. It typically grows on limestone or other calcium-rich substrates, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces. The plant lacks distinct stems or leaves, instead consisting of a dense mat of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for limestone ecosystems."
