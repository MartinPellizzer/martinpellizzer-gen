    "intro": "Diosma angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf diosma, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
