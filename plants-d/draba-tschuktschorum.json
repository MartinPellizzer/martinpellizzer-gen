It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia, it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
