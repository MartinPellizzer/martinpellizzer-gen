    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudodichaea, commonly known as the orchid with the striking red and yellow flowers, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, thin pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Dendrobium pseudodichaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
