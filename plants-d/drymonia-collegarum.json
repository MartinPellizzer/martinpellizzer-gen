    "intro": "Drymonia collegarum, commonly known as the Florida drymonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often branching. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
