    "intro": "Davallia flaccida var. pubera, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fern-like fronds with a soft, hairy texture on the underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
