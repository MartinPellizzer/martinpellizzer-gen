It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in the unique volcanic soil and microclimates of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
