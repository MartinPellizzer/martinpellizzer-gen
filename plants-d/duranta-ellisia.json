    "intro": "Duranta ellisia, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-green flowers that transition to orange-red as they mature. These flowers are followed by oval, blue-black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Duranta ellisia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract birds."
