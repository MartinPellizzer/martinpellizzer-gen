    "intro": "Draconanthes venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan dragon orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear showy, violet to purple blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
