    "intro": "Delphinium napellus, commonly known as the European larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its root system consists of fibrous roots. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower displays. Delphinium napellus is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
