    "intro": "Desmodium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, spiny pods. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, three-lobed pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Desmodium palmeri is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
