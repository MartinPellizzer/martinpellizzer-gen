    "intro": "Draba zionensis, commonly known as the Zion dwarf cress, is a small flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in the Zion National Park area of Utah. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between March and May. Draba zionensis is adapted to rocky, arid environments and is often found in crevices or on steep slopes. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
