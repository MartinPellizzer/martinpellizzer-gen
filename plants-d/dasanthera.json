    "intro": "Dasanthera, commonly known as the goldcrest or yellow sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to western North America. The plants typically have basal leaves and produce small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and are characterized by their four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Dasanthera species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
