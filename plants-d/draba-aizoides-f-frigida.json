    "intro": "Draba aizoides f. frigida, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold climates in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine, or arctic environments, where it forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Draba aizoides f. frigida is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems."
