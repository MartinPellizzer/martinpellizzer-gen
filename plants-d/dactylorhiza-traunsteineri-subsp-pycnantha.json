    "intro": "Dactylorhiza traunsteineri subsp. pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, calcareous soils. The plant features a rhizome with several leaf-like structures and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish to yellowish flowers. Its flowers are usually arranged in a dense spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. This orchid is noted for its ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity in wetland habitats."
