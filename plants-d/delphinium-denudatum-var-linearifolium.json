    "intro": "Delphinium denudatum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the slenderleaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with spurred petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for gardens with small children or pets."
