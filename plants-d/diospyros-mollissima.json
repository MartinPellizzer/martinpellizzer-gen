    "intro": "Diospyros mollissima, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree bears edible, round fruits that resemble small dates, with a sweet, juicy pulp and a hard, inedible seed. Its bark is smooth and dark when young, becoming fissured with age. Diospyros mollissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
