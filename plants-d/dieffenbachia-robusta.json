    "intro": "Dieffenbachia robusta, commonly known as the Leopard Plant, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other popular houseplants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Dieffenbachia robusta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor decoration due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
