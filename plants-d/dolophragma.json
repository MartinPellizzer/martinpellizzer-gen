    "intro": "Dolophragma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that shifts subtly under different light conditions. The plant's botanical features include milky sap and lanceolate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Despite its beauty, Dolophragma is relatively rare and requires specific care to flourish in cultivation."
