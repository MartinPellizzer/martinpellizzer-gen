    "intro": "Daphne gnidium f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved daphne, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
