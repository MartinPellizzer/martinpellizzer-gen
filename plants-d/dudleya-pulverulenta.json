    "intro": "Dudleya pulverulenta, commonly known as the dustymallow, is a succulent plant native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Dudleya pulverulenta is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
