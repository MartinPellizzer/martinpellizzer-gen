    "intro": "Deyeuxia hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Deyeuxia hillebrandii plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
