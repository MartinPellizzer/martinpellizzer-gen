It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open fields, roadsides, and pastures. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often considered a weed but can serve as forage for livestock in certain conditions."
