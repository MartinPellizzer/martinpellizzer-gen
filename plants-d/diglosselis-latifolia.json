The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
