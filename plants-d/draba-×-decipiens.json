    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 decipiens, commonly known as the hybrid winter cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Draba nemorosa and Draba repens, characterized by its low-growing habit and dense rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in tight clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
