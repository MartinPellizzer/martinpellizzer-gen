It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It typically grows in rocky habitats and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
