    "intro": "Dactylis villosa, commonly known as hairy grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, wiry stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Dactylis villosa is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand grazing."
