    "intro": "Dischidia alternans, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Dischidia alternans is also known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it a versatile addition to hanging baskets or shelves."
