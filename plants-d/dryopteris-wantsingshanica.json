    "intro": "Dryopteris wantsingshanica, commonly known as the Wansingshan Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
