    "intro": "Dryopteris holmei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features large, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically divided into lobes that resemble shields, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
