    "intro": "Dryopteris teuscheri, commonly known as the Teuscher's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, hairy covering."
