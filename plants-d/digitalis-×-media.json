    "intro": "Digitalis \u00d7 media, commonly known as the common foxglove, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of tubular, hooded flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which have medicinal uses but are also toxic. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Digitalis \u00d7 media thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
