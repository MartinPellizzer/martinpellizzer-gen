    "intro": "Dendrophthoe scurrula, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Euphorbiaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can remain attached to its host for many years. Dendrophthoe scurrula is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments."
