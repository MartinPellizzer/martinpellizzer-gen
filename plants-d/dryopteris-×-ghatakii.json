    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 ghatakii, commonly known as the Ghatakii shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carthusiana and Dryopteris pentaphylla. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to the eastern Himalayas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
