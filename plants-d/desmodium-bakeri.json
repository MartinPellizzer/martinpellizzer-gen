    "intro": "Desmodium bakeri, commonly known as the purple burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
