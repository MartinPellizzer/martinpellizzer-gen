    "intro": "Dioscorea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its rhizomes contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, the plant is toxic and requires careful handling due to the presence of steroidal saponins."
