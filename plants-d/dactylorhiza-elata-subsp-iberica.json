    "intro": "Dactylorhiza elata subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a complex root system adapted to its wetland habitat. This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
