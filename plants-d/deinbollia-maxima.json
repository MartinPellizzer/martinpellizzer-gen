    "intro": "Deinbollia maxima, commonly known as the giant hydnoid, is a species of fungi in the family Hydnaceae. It is characterized by its large, irregularly shaped, sponge-like fruiting body that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The spore-bearing surface is smooth and often covered with a thin, membranous layer. The basidia are club-shaped and produce spores in a single layer. It typically grows on decaying wood in tropical and subtropical regions."
