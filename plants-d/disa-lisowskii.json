    "intro": "Disa lisowskii, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing clusters of pale pink to white petals with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Disa lisowskii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
