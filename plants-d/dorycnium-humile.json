    "intro": "Dorycnium humile, commonly known as the small goat's beard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
