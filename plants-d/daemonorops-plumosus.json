    "intro": "Daemonorops plumosus, commonly known as the silky cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are soft and feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
