    "intro": "Danthonia hispida, commonly known as the hairy danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
