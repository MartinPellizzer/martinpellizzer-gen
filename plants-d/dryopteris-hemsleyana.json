    "intro": "Dryopteris hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and the sori are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
