    "intro": "Dorycnium suffruticosum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that can become quite bushy. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and it produces yellow pea-like flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a spindle-shaped pod containing several elliptical seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
