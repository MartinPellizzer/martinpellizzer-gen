It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flattened, seed-like structures. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Dalbergiella gossweileri is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
