    "intro": "Dendrobium tuberiferum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with long, cane-like stems that often bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces fleshy, tuberous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged spirally along the stems. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
