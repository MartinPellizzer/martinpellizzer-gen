    "intro": "Drosera enodes, commonly known as the slender sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrients obtained from its prey. Its leaves are narrow and often form dense rosettes, enhancing its ability to capture prey. Drosera enodes is a perennial species that produces small, white flowers during the warmer months."
