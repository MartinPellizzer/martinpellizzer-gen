    "intro": "Dryopteris stegnogramme, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by protective indusia."
