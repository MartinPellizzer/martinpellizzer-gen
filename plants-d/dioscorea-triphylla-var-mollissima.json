    "intro": "Dioscorea triphylla var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and its tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some cultures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both an important ornamental and a valuable agricultural crop in certain regions."
