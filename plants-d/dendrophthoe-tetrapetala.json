    "intro": "Dendrophthoe tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid environments. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis."
