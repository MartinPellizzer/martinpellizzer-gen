    "intro": "Dracula ubangina, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark red or crimson flowers, which resemble blood, giving it its common name. The plant has a slender, branching stem and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Dracula ubangina thrives in high humidity and partial shade, typically growing on the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
