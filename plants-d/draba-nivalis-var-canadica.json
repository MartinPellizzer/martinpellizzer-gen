    "intro": "Draba nivalis var. canadica, commonly known as the Canadian rock cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often among the snowpack. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers."
