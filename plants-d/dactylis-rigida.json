    "intro": "Dactylis rigida, commonly known as rigid goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including poor and dry soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas, and is valued for its forage quality. Dactylis rigida is also notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
