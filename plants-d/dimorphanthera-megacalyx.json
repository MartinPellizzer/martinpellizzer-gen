    "intro": "Dimorphanthera megacalyx, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The leaves have a thick waxy cuticle that helps them stay afloat and resist water loss."
