    "intro": "Dryopteris rudis var. gradata, commonly known as the graduated fern, is a variant of the rough shield fern. It is a medium-sized fern characterized by its fronds that gradually increase in size along their length. The plant features a dense, wiry rhizome and produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage has a distinctive, graduated appearance that makes it visually appealing in horticultural settings."
