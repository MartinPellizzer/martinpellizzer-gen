    "intro": "Druparia prunus, commonly known as the cherry tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy flowers. It produces drupes, or stones, which are fleshy fruits enclosing a hard inner seed. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, with a broad canopy and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it blooms in spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit ripens in summer, providing food for various wildlife and humans alike."
