    "intro": "Dupatya caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered grass or dwarf bamboo, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense clumps, which help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Dupatya caespitosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
