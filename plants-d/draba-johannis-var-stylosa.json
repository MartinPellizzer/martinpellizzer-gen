    "intro": "Draba johannis var. stylosa, commonly known as the slender whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces elongated, slender flower stalks that bear small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
