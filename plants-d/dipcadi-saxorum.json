    "intro": "Dipcadi saxorum, commonly known as the saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, often blue or purple leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in a dense inflorescence. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
