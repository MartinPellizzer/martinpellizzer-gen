    "intro": "Dacrydium elatum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver pine, is a variant of the silver pine species native to New Zealand. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The foliage has a silvery-blue hue due to a waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
