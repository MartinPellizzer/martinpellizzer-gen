    "intro": "Diospyros pilosula, commonly known as the silky persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that are usually pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its fruits are edible, though some varieties may have astringent qualities when unripe. Diospyros pilosula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of persimmons in tropical and subtropical regions."
