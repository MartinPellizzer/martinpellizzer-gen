It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
