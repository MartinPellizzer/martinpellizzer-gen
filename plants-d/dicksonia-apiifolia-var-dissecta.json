    "intro": "Dicksonia apiifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in coastal and forested areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in nighttime pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
