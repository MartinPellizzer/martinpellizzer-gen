    "intro": "Delphinium elatum subsp. pubicaule, commonly known as the garden delphinium, is a tall, showy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The subspecies is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
