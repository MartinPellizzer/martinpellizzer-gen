It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, adapting to nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems forming a clump over time. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Dendrobium lithocola requires specific conditions, including good air circulation and moderate light, to thrive."
