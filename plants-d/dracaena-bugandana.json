    "intro": "Dracaena bugandana, commonly known as the African violet or the red-edged dracaena, is a tropical plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often red-veined. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear at the top of the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena bugandana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
