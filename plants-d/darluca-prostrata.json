    "intro": "Darluca prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate darluca, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Darluca prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
