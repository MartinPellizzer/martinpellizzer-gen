    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 kelleriana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid between Dactylorhiza lapponica and Dactylorhiza macdougallii, characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. It is also of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability."
