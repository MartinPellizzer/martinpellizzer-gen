    "intro": "Diplopeltis lehmannii, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble leopard spots. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
