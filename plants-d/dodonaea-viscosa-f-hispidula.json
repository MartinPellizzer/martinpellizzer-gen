It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
