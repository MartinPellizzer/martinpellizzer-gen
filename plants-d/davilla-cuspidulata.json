    "intro": "Davilla cuspidulata, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
