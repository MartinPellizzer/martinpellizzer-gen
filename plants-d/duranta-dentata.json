    "intro": "Duranta dentata, commonly known as the silverleaf duranta, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by orange or yellow berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Duranta dentata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
