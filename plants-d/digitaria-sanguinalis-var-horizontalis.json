    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. horizontalis, commonly known as the flat-seeded crabgrass, is a warm-season annual grass that thrives in disturbed soils. It has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to compete with other vegetation. The species is characterized by its horizontal growth habit, which helps it spread efficiently across the ground."
