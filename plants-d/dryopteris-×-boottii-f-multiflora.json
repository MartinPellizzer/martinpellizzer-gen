    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 boottii f. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora fern, is a hybrid fern species belonging to the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green hue and a slightly curled appearance. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
