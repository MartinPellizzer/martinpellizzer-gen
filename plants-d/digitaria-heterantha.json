    "intro": "Digitaria heterantha, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has potential uses in erosion control."
