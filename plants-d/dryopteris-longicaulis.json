    "intro": "Dryopteris longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dark brown, scaly roots and upright, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
