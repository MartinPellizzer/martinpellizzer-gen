    "intro": "Dipteracanthus erectus, commonly known as the upright dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
