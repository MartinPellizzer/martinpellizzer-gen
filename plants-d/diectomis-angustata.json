    "intro": "Diectomis angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf diectomis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often in shades of violet or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
