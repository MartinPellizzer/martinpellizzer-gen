It features rosettes of narrow, red-tipped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and vibrant color make it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
