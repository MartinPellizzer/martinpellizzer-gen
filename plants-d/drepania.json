    "intro": "Drepania, commonly known as the basket fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble baskets, hence their common name. Drepania species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense clumps. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils."
