    "intro": "Dictamnus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dictamnus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is released when the stems are broken."
