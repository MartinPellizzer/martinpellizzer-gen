    "intro": "Danais ternata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces round, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. While not edible for humans, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
