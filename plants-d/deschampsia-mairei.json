    "intro": "Deschampsia mairei, commonly known as Maire's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that becomes more prominent in the summer months. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicles, adding a graceful appearance to its overall form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Deschampsia mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
