    "intro": "Diplazium elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a graceful, arching growth habit that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
