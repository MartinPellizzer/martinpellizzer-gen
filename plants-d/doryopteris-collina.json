    "intro": "Doryopteris collina, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sori. Doryopteris collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
