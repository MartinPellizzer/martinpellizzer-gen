    "intro": "Dodonaea viscosa var. galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos screwtree, is a shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the island's arid climate. This variety is closely related to the more widely distributed Dodonaea viscosa but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological traits."
