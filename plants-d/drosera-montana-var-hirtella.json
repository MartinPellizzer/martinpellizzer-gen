    "intro": "Drosera montana var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glandular-hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense spike, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This variety is closely related to other Drosera species and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
