    "intro": "Dalbergia swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's rosewood, is a rare and highly valued tropical hardwood tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, and features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, often clustered in dense spikes, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and listed on the IUCN Red List."
