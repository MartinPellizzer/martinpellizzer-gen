    "intro": "Dendrophylax constanzensis, commonly known as the Constantz orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
