It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, grayish-green foliage that adds texture to gardens, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
