    "intro": "Delphinium kohatense var. gilgitense, commonly known as the Gilgit delphinium, is a striking perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Gilgit-Baltistan region in Pakistan. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a soft, velvety texture, typical of the Delphinium genus. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
