    "intro": "Didyplosandra lurida var. bourneae, commonly known as the Bourne's ghost tree, is a rare and unique species native to the humid forests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, waxy, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the axils of the leaves. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation priority due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
