    "intro": "Diplazium divergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Diplazium divergens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
