    "intro": "Dendrobium minimum, commonly known as the small dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a delicate fragrance. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, and it prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity. Dendrobium minimum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
