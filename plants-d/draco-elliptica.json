    "intro": "Draco elliptica, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its umbrella-like crown of thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap is famous for its deep red color and has been used historically for medicinal and dye purposes. The plant's distinctive appearance and ecological adaptations make it a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation in extreme climates."
