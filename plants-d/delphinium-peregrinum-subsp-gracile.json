    "intro": "Delphinium peregrinum subsp. gracile, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
