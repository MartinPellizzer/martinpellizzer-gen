    "intro": "Deparia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups known as sorus."
