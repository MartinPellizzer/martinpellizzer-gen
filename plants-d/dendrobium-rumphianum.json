    "intro": "Dendrobium rumphianum, commonly known as the orchid of the highlands, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with branched stems that often hang or trail from trees. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically blooming during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Dendrobium rumphianum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
