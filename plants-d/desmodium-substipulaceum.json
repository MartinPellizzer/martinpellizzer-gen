    "intro": "Desmodium substipulaceum, commonly known as the small-leaf velvet bean, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by small, flat pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility."
