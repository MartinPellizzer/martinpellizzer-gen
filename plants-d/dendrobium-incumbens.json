    "intro": "Dendrobium incumbens, commonly known as the purple-tinged orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or mounted displays. Dendrobium incumbens is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
