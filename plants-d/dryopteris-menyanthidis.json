    "intro": "Dryopteris menyanthidis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered with a waxy bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that give it a rugged appearance. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
