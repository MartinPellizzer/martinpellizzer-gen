    "intro": "Didymocarpus secundiflorus, commonly known as the clustered flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, rounded crown. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green surface. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
