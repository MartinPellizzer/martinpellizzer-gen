    "intro": "Diplazium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
