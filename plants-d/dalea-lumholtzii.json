    "intro": "Dalea lumholtzii, commonly known as the Lumholtz's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility. Dalea lumholtzii is often found in open habitats where it contributes to local biodiversity."
