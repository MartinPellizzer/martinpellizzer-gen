    "intro": "Drosanthemum robustum, commonly known as the woolly pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Drosanthemum robustum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
