    "intro": "Dendrobium oblongum, commonly known as the oblong orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in two rows along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
