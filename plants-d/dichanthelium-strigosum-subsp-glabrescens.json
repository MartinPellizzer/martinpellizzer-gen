It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie flat on the ground, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth, silky texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in moist environments and its distinctive, finely textured foliage."
