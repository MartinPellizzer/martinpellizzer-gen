    "intro": "Daphniphyllopsis, commonly known as the cycadeoid plant, is a genus of extinct seed plants that thrived during the Mesozoic era. These plants are characterized by their large, fern-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure known as a megasporangium. They are considered relatives of cycads and ginkgoes, sharing some morphological similarities. Daphniphyllopsis fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating their prevalence in ancient swampy environments. Their study provides important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleobotanical history of the Earth."
