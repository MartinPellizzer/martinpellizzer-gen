    "intro": "Dipterygium scabrum, commonly known as rough dipterygium, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
