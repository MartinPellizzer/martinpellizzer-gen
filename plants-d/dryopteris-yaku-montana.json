    "intro": "Dryopteris yaku-montana, commonly known as the Yaku Mountain wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a deep green color and a slightly curled appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
