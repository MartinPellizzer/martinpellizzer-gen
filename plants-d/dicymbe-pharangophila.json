    "intro": "Dicymbe pharangophila, commonly known as the mountain balsam, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fruit is a legume pod that dehisces to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family. Dicymbe pharangophila is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
