    "intro": "Dendrobium wardianum var. pictum, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has long, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and it produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in two rows along the stem. The variety *pictum* is distinguished by its intricate, patterned markings on the petals and sepals, which give it its common name."
