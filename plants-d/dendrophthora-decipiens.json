    "intro": "Dendrophthora decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale green berries. It is often found in temperate forests and can cause stress to its host by draining its resources. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a complex role in forest ecosystems."
