    "intro": "Dendrobium sarcochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments rather than in the wild."
