    "intro": "Desmostachys brevipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in desert or sagebrush habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, compound leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white, pea-like flowers. Its root system is adapted to drought, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
