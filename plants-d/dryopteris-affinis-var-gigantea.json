    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a large, vigorous fern native to eastern North America. It features broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, lush colonies in suitable conditions."
