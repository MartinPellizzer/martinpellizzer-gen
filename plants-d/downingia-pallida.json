    "intro": "Downingia pallida, commonly known as the pale downingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Downingia pallida thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments."
