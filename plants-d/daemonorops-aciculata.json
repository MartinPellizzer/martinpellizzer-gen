    "intro": "Daemonorops aciculata, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the palm family, Arecaceae, and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, woody pod and are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Daemonorops aciculata is considered vulnerable to extinction in the wild."
