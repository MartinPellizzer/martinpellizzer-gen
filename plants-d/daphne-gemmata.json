    "intro": "Daphne gemmata, commonly known as the silver leaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often overlooked in favor of its ornamental value. Daphne gemmata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooms make it a standout addition to botanical collections."
