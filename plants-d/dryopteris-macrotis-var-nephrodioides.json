    "intro": "Dryopteris macrotis var. nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually a deep green, with a velvety texture and a slightly curled margin. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
