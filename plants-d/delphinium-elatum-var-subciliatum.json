    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. subciliatum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while the flowers are arranged in spikes at the top of the stem. This variety is characterized by its finely toothed, ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which give it its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
