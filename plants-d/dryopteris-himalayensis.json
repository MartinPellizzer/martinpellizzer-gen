    "intro": "Dryopteris himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins."
