    "intro": "Dendrorkis caduca, commonly known as the deciduous tree of the orchid family, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically alternate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale pink in color. Dendrorkis caduca is known for its ability to shed its leaves seasonally, a trait that helps it conserve resources in its native habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
