    "intro": "Didymopanax auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears tree, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest leafy plants in the world. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
