    "intro": "Dioscorea triphylla var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined yam, is a perennial climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as food in some cultures. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tubers of this variety are typically smaller than those of other yam species but are valued for their nutritional content."
