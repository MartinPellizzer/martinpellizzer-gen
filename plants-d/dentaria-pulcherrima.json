    "intro": "Dentaria pulcherrima, commonly known as the showy toothcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are toothed along the edges, giving it its common name. It produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, seed-containing pods. Dentaria pulcherrima thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
