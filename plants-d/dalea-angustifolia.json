    "intro": "Dalea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea angustifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
