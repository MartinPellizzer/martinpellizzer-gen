    "intro": "Dipteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dicksoniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into two types: fertile and sterile, with the latter typically being more delicate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Dipteris species are known for their ability to form dense mats, which can contribute to soil stabilization. Botanically, they exhibit a unique reproductive system involving spores and have a complex life cycle with both sporophytic and gametophytic stages."
