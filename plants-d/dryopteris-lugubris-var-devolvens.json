    "intro": "Dryopteris lugubris var. devolvens, commonly known as the weeping wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive drooping fronds. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a robust rhizome with pinnately compound fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly curled appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
