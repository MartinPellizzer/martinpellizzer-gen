    "intro": "Diploperianthium, commonly known as the double-flowered thistle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically features spiny leaves and a robust stem, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Diploperianthium species are native to regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
