    "intro": "Dortmanna scabra var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is less common than the typical form of Dortmanna scabra and is often found in still or slow-moving water."
