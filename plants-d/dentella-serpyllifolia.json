    "intro": "Dentella serpyllifolia, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features fine, tufted shoots with a dense, mat-like growth habit, often forming a carpet on the ground. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green color, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along pathways. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
