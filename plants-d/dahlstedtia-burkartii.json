It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a unique touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
