    "intro": "Dendrobium informe, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium informe is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience."
