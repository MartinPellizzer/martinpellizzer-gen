    "intro": "Dupatya saxicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and is often found growing in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with showy, reflexed petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Dupatya saxicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
