    "intro": "Diplotaxis hirta, commonly known as African cabbages or wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep taproot system for water absorption. Diplotaxis hirta is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
