    "intro": "Drymocallis poteriifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
