It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three feet in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like structure. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found near waterways. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
