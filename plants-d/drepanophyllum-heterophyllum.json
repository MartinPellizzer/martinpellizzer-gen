    "intro": "Drepanophyllum heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its berries are dark blue to black and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
