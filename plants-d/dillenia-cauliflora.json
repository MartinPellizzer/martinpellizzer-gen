    "intro": "Dillenia cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical dillenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, large, white or pinkish flowers that are often borne in clusters at the base of the stem, a feature known as cauliflorous growth. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruits are fleshy berries that contain multiple seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Dillenia cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
