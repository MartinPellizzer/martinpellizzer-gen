    "intro": "Dryopteris subthelypteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
