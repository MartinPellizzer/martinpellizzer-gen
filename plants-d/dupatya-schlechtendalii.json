    "intro": "Dupatya schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Dupatya schlechtendalii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
