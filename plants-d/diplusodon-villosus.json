    "intro": "Diplusodon villosus, commonly known as the hairy antplant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and the ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a velvety texture due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. Diplusodon villosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
