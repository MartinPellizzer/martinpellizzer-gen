    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp. thermale, commonly known as the hot spring grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm, wet habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist soils near springs and along stream banks, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
