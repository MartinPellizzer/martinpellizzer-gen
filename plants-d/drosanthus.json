    "intro": "Drosanthus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellow-to-orange star-shaped flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Drosanthus typically grows low to the ground, with woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bloom period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape."
