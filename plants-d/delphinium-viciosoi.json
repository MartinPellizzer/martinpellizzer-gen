    "intro": "Delphinium viciosoi, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, supporting clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Delphinium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant are toxic, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
