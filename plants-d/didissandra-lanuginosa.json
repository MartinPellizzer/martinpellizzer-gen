    "intro": "Didissandra lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly didissandra, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanuginous, leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
