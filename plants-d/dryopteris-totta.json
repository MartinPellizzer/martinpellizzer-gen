    "intro": "Dryopteris totta, commonly known as the Totta wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, narrow, and linear shape. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and smaller veins running parallel to it. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
