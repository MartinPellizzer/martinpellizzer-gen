    "intro": "Digitaria fenestrata, commonly known as the window grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Digitaria fenestrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
