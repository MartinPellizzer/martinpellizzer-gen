    "intro": "Drepananthus, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species characterized by their daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have silver or grayish foliage, which helps them conserve water in arid environments. They produce small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. Drepananthus species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
