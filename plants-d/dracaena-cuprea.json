    "intro": "Dracaena cuprea, commonly known as the red dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking reddish-orange variegated leaves, which add visual interest to indoor spaces. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with a smooth, dark green stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Dracaena cuprea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying properties."
