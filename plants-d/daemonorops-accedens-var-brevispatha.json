It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves with short petioles. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly distinctive in appearance. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
