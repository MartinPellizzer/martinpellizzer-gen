    "intro": "Daphne rupestris, commonly known as the rock daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thick, aromatic leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique winter foliage. Daphne rupestris is relatively hardy but requires careful handling due to its toxic sap."
