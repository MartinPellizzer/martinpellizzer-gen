    "intro": "Deyeuxia aequivalvis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false rice, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a grass-like appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed within the leaf sheaths. Deyeuxia aequivalvis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
