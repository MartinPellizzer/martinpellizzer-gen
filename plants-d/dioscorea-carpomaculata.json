It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and bears yellow, fragrant flowers that are followed by cylindrical, spiny fruits. The tuberous roots of D. carpomaculata are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines and herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
