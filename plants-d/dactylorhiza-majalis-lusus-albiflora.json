    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
