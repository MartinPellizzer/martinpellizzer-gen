    "intro": "Danthonia decumbens subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in dunes and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
