    "intro": "Dryopteris atasripii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
