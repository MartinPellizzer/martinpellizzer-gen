    "intro": "Delphinium altissimum subsp. drepanocentrum, commonly known as the Alpine larkspur, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in tall spikes, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Due to its height and vibrant flowers, it is often used in rock gardens and as a backdrop in wildflower displays."
