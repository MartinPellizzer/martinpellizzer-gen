It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, bell-shaped capsule, which splits open to release the seeds.
