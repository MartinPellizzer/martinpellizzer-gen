    "intro": "Dianthus diffusus var. dolopicus, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-red flowers with white markings. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
