    "intro": "Dryopteris monocarpa, commonly known as the single-fruited wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a single row, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Dryopteris monocarpa is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
