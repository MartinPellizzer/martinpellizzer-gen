    "intro": "Dyckia congesta, commonly known as the clustered dyckia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. Dyckia congesta is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
