    "intro": "Dectis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dectis decurrens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
