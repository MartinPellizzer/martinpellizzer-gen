    "intro": "Dryopteris albovillosa, commonly known as the silvery wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive silvery-white underleaf hairs. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit that adds ornamental value to gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and conservation efforts."
