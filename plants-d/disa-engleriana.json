It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, producing intricate blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.
