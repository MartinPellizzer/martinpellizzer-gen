    "intro": "Digitaria puberula, commonly known as hairy digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Digitaria puberula is adapted to warm climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
