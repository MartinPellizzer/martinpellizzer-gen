It is characterized by its distinctive globular seed pods that contain live embryos, a trait known as viviparity. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are showy, ranging from white to pink, and bloom in late spring. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
