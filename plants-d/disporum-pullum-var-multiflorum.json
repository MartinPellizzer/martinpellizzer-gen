    "intro": "Disporum pullum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a variant of the Pacific silver fir, a conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and conical shape, typical of many fir species. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into cone-like structures, which contain the seeds. This variant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
