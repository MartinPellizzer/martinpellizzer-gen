    "intro": "Dombeya glandulosissima, commonly known as the woolly dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
