    "intro": "Dionysia revoluta subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute dionysia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has hairy, narrow leaves that are often revolute, meaning they curl under at the edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
