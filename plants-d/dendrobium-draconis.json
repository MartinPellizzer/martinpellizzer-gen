    "intro": "Dendrobium draconis, commonly known as the dragon's tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, wiry stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Dendrobium draconis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
