    "intro": "Disparago tortilis, commonly known as the twisted false hellebore, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
