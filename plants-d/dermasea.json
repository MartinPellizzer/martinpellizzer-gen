    "intro": "Dermasea, commonly known as the \"buttercup moss,\" is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, rosette-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a simple, non-vascular structure, with leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Dermasea plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
