    "intro": "Daturicarpa firmula, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a dark purple color. Daturicarpa firmula is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
