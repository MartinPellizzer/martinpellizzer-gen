    "intro": "Dactylorhiza comosa, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as bogs, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with hairy, grass-like leaves and a spike of pale pink to white flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Dactylorhiza comosa is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
