    "intro": "Digitaria reflexa, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a species of grass native to Africa, Asia, and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Digitaria reflexa is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
