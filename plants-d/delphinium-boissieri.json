It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in raceme inflorescences, which bloom in late summer.

Delphinium boissieri is adapted to cold, alpine environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
