It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to dry and coastal environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its fruits are small, red berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
