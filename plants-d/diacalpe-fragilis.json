    "intro": "Diacalpe fragilis, commonly known as the brittle-leaf diacalpe, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thin leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its fragility, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
