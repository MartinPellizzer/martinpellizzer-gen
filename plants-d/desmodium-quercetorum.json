    "intro": "Desmodium quercetorum, commonly known as the redstem burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in forage and soil improvement."
