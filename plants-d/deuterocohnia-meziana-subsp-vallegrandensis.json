    "intro": "Deuterocohnia meziana subsp. vallegrandensis, commonly known as the Vallegrandensis Pothos, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a compact, evergreen perennial with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
