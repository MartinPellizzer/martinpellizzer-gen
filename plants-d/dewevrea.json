    "intro": "Dewevrea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and purple, which bloom in clusters. Dewevrea is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential invasive species in some regions."
