    "intro": "Drosera parvula subsp. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's Sundew, is a small carnivorous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap insects for nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
