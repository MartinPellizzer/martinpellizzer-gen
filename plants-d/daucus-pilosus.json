    "intro": "Daucus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy parsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and celery. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Daucus pilosus is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
