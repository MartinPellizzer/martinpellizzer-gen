    "intro": "Dorstenia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori star vine, is a unique member of the family Malvaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiraling stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to cultivate."
