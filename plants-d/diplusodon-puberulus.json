    "intro": "Diplusodon puberulus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
