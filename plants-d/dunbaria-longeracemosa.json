    "intro": "Dunbaria longeracemosa, commonly known as the long-bracted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with long, slender bracts that give the plant its specific epithet. The leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suited to rocky or alpine environments."
