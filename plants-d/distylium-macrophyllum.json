    "intro": "Distylium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a fleshy, red berry containing one or two seeds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
