    "intro": "Dryopteris patens var. stipularis, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a variant of the broad male fern. It is a perennial fern native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
