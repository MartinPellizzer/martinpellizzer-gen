    "intro": "Didymocarpus, commonly known as the \"double fruit\" or \"false mango,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It comprises approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Didymocarpus species produce berries that are often edible, though some contain toxic compounds. These plants are valued for their ornamental value and, in some cases, for their potential medicinal properties."
