    "intro": "Dalea dalea, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Dalea dalea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
