It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and bear small, greenish-white flowers. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dortmanna amygdalina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
