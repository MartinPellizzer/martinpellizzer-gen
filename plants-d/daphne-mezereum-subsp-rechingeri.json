    "intro": "Daphne mezereum subsp. rechingeri, commonly known as the early daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value lies in its early blooming habit and distinctive foliage."
