    "intro": "Daphne glomerata var. puberula, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with thick, waxy leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
