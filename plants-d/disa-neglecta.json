It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats and is often found in grassland or fynbos vegetation. It produces a small, capsule-like fruit that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
