    "intro": "Diplazium leptocarpon, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a member of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating the spread of the plant. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
