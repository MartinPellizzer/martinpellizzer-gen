    "intro": "Digitaria thouarsiana, commonly known as the African grass or digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
