    "intro": "Dendrobium unifoliatum, commonly known as the single-leaf dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a single, fleshy leaf and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium unifoliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
