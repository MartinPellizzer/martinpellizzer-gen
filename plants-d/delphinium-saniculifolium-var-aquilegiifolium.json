It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of blue to purple spurred flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive, finely toothed margin, resembling the leaves of the water plantain. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
