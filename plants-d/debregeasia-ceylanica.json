    "intro": "Debregeasia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon mountain ash, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Debregeasia ceylanica is adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
