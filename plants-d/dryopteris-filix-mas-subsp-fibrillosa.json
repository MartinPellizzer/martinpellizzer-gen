    "intro": "Dryopteris filix-mas subsp. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous male fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and the sori are clustered on the underside of the pinnae. This subspecies is noted for its fibrous, hairy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
