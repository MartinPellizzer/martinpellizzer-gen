    "intro": "Dendrobium longirepens, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often adorned with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, are typically spurred and bloom sequentially along the stem. Dendrobium longirepens is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
