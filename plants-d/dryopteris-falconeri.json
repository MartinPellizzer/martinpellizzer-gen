    "intro": "Dryopteris falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
