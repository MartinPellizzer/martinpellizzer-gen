    "intro": "Digitorebutia haagei, commonly known as the Haage's digitate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, digitate (finger-like) stems that are often branched. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
