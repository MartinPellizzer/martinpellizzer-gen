    "intro": "Drimia rotunda, commonly known as the African daisy, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms. Drimia rotunda is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers."
