    "intro": "Dinebra americana, commonly known as the American bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive bladder-like seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. The botanical features of Dinebra americana make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
