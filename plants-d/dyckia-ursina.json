    "intro": "Dyckia ursina, commonly known as the bear's tail plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a tight, water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, red bracts that bloom in the spring. Dyckia ursina thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
