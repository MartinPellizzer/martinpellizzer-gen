    "intro": "Duckeella adolphii, commonly known as the Adolph's duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, often arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments. Duckeella adolphii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
