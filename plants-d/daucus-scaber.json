    "intro": "Daucus scaber, commonly known as rough carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like parsley and celery. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. Its roots are typically small and not as commercially valuable as those of the common carrot. Daucus scaber is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
