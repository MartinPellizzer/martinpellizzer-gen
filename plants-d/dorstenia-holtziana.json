    "intro": "Dorstenia holtziana, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its swollen, bottle-like stems that store water, adapting to its often arid habitat. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences. Despite its unusual appearance, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant that can be grown in containers or as a houseplant with proper care."
