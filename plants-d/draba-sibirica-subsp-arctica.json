    "intro": "Draba sibirica subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant has small, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing some insulation against the cold. Its flowers are yellow and appear in early summer, adding a bright touch to the otherwise muted landscape. This subspecies is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats."
