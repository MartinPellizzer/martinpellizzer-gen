    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside of the leaves."
