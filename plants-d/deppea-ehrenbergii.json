    "intro": "Deppea ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are showy, with five pink to reddish-purple petals that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Deppea ehrenbergii is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
