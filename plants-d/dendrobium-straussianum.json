    "intro": "Dendrobium straussianum, commonly known as the Strasburg orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, thick stem that branches to form a dense cluster of pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in two rows along the stem. Dendrobium straussianum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
