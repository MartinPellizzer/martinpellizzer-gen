    "intro": "Dicranolepis polyloba, commonly known as the many-lobed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often divided into numerous lobes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its fronds are usually evergreen and can persist for several years. Dicranolepis polyloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
