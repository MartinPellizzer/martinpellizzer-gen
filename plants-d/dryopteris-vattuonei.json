    "intro": "Dryopteris vattuonei, commonly known as the Vattuone wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive clusters called sori. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
