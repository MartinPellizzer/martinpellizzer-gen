    "intro": "Diospyros wieseneri, commonly known as the Wiesener's persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries that are edible when fully ripe. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited economic importance due to its restricted distribution."
