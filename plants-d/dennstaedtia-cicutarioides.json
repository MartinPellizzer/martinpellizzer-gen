    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cicutarioides, commonly known as the fern moss or the clubmoss fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats."
