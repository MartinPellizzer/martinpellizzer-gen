    "intro": "Dendrophylax sallei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in areas with high air humidity and indirect light. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
