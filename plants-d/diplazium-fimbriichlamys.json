    "intro": "Diplazium fimbriichlamys, commonly known as the fringed-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often adorned with fine, fringed margins. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the stabilization of aquatic sediments. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, which aid in its buoyancy and photosynthetic efficiency."
