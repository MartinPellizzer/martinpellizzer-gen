    "intro": "Dortmanna surrepens, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Dortmanna surrepens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
