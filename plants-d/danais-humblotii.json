    "intro": "Danais humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's danais, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure with vividly colored petals and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Danais humblotii is considered an endangered species."
