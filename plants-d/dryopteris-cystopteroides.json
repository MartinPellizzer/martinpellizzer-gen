    "intro": "Dryopteris cystopteroides, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread across forest floors. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that becomes more complex as the plant matures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
