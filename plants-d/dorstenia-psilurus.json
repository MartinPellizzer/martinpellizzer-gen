    "intro": "Dorstenia psilurus, commonly known as the slender-dorstenia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a spiral staircase, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Its leaves are typically alternate and often have a distinctive shape with a narrow, elongated form. Dorstenia psilurus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
