    "intro": "Dicliptera ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Dicliptera ciliata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
