    "intro": "Disocactus \u00d7 jenkinsonii, commonly known as the hybrid pachypodium, is a hybrid cactus species resulting from the cross between Disocactus leonis and Disocactus phyllocladus. It is characterized by its columnar stem with thick, fleshy ribs and sparse, often spiny foliage. The plant produces striking, large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
