    "intro": "Dryopteris yenpingensis, commonly known as the Yenping Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
