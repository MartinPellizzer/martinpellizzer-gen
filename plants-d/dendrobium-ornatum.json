    "intro": "Dendrobium ornatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the South, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Dendrobium ornatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
