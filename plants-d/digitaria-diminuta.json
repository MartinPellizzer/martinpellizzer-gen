    "intro": "Digitaria diminuta, commonly known as small Digitaria, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
