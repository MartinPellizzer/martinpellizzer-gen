    "intro": "Dopatrium tricolor, commonly known as the three-color bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive three-lobed, bladder-like fruits that turn red as they mature. Dopatrium tricolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its unique fruit morphology and seasonal color changes make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
