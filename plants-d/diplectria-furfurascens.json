    "intro": "Diplectria furfurascens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is introduced."
