    "intro": "Diplazium cultrifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a single central vein and small, oval-shaped pinnae. Diplazium cultrifolium is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
