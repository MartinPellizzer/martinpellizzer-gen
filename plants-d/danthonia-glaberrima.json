    "intro": "Danthonia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are generally smooth and lack the coarse texture found in many other grass species. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Danthonia glaberrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
