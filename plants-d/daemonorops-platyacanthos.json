    "intro": "Daemonorops platyacanthos, commonly known as the broad-armed cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
