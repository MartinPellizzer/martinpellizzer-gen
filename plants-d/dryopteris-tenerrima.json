    "intro": "Dryopteris tenerrima, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
