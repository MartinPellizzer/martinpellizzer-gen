    "intro": "Dalea coerulea var. longispicata, commonly known as the bluebonnet, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its showy flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The variety longispicata is distinguished by its longer, more prominent flower spikes compared to the typical form."
