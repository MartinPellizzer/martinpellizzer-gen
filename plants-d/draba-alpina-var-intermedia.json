    "intro": "Draba alpina var. intermedia, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds, and is often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar morphological features. This variety is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical Draba alpina and other related species."
