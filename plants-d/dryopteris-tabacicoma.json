    "intro": "Dryopteris tabacicoma, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
