    "intro": "Dioscorea borealis, commonly known as the northern yam, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are unisexual and occur in clusters. The tubers of Dioscorea borealis are not widely cultivated for food but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
