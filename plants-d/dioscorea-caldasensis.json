    "intro": "Dioscorea caldasensis, commonly known as the Caldas yam, is a perennial vine native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tubers are used in traditional medicine and as a food source, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The species is valued for its ecological role in its native habitat and its potential for agricultural use."
