    "intro": "Deiregyne trilineata, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine hairs, which help in absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature among ferns."
