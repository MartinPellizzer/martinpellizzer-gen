It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a rosette growth form. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
