    "intro": "Dematophyllum salsoloides, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Dematophyllum salsoloides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils."
