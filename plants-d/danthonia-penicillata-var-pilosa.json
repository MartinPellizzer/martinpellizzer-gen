    "intro": "Danthonia penicillata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy danthonia, is a grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
