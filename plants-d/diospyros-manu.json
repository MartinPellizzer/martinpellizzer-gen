    "intro": "Diospyros manu, commonly known as the Manu persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family, which includes other well-known species like the ebony tree. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns from green to orange-red when mature, and it is edible when fully ripe. The tree is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber."
