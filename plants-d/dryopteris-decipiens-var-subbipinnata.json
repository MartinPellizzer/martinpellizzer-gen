    "intro": "Dryopteris decipiens var. subbipinnata, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with the lower pinnae often shorter and more crowded than the upper ones. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
