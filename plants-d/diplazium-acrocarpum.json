    "intro": "Diplazium acrocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted for underwater life. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Diplazium acrocarpum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
