    "intro": "Deplanchea novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian bower vine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in greenhouses and tropical gardens. However, it requires high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive optimally."
