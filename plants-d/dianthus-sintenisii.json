    "intro": "Dianthus sintenisii, commonly known as the Sierra madre dianthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, often adorned with distinctive white or pale pink markings. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
