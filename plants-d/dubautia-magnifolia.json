    "intro": "Dubautia magnifolia, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Dubautia magnifolia is a federally endangered species, protected due to habitat loss and introduced pests. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important symbol of Hawaii's natural heritage."
