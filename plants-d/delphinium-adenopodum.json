It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a soft, woolly texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
