It features elongated, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin, often displaying a striking contrast between the green and brown hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
