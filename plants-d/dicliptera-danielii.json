It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry or semi-arid environments. Dicliptera danielii is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some local communities."
