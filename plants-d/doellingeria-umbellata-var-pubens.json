It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. The pubescent varietal name refers to the hairy texture of its foliage, a distinguishing feature in its botanical description."
