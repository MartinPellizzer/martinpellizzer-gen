It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
