    "intro": "Desmodium menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla sensitive pea, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait that may aid in defense against herbivores. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
