    "intro": "Dryopteris supranitens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside of the leaves."
