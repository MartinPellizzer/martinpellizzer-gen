    "intro": "Delphinium emiliae, commonly known as Emilia's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium emiliae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
