    "intro": "Deparia boryana subsp. boryana, commonly known as the Bory's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteris genus. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
