It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
