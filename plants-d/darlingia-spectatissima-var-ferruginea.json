    "intro": "Darlingia spectatissima var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty darlingia, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rust-colored hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
