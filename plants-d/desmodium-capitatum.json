    "intro": "Desmodium capitatum, commonly known as the common burr medic, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a legume characterized by its erect, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular heads, which give it its common name. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Desmodium capitatum is often used in agricultural systems for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
