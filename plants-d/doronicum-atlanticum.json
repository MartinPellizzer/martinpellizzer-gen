    "intro": "Doronicum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the western Mediterranean. It features basal rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It is well adapted to salt spray and moderate drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
