    "intro": "Doria flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Doria flexicaulis is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
