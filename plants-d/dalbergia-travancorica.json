    "intro": "Dalbergia travancorica, commonly known as Travancore rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The species is also notable for its slow growth and is considered a vulnerable species due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
