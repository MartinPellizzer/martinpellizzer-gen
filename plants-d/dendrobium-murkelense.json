    "intro": "Dendrobium murkelense, commonly known as the Murkel's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dendrobium murkelense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
