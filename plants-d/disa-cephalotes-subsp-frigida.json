It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences with bright pink to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
