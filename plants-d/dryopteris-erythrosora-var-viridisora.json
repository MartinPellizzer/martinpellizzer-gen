    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrosora var. viridisora, commonly known as the Green Shield Fern, is a variant of the Red Shield Fern characterized by its lush, emerald-green fronds. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate leaves. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various small organisms. The varietal distinction is primarily based on the color and texture of its fronds compared to the typical variety."
