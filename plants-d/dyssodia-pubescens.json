    "intro": "Dyssodia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dyssodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dyssodia pubescens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
