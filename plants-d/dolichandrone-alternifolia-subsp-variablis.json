    "intro": "Dolichandrone alternifolia subsp. variablis, commonly known as the variable dolichandrone, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, alternate leaf arrangement and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant exhibits considerable morphological variation, which contributes to its subspecies classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
