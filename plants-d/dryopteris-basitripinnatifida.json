    "intro": "Dryopteris basitripinnatifida, commonly known as the broad male fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, fern-like structure with a broad, triangular shape. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
