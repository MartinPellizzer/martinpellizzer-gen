    "intro": "Dracaena porteri, commonly known as the giant dracaena, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It features long, narrow, dark green leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a dramatic, architectural appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Dracaena porteri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience."
