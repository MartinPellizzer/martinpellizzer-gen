    "intro": "Dennstaedtia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Dennstaedtia cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture and landscape design."
