    "intro": "Dryopteris canescens var. degener, commonly known as the degenerate lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its reduced frond size and simplified morphology. It is a perennial fern native to North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with dimorphic fronds, where the sterile fronds are often shorter and less complex than those of the typical species. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fertile fronds. This variant exhibits a unique adaptation to its habitat, showcasing the variability within the Dryopteris genus."
