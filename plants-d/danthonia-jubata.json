    "intro": "Danthonia jubata, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Danthonia jubata is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
