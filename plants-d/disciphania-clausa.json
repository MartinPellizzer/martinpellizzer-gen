    "intro": "Disciphania clausa, commonly known as the closed disc fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, rounded fronds that are tightly clustered. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its family."
