    "intro": "Dendrobium fusiforme, commonly known as the spindle orchid, is a sympodial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, spindle-shaped pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulb. Dendrobium fusiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
