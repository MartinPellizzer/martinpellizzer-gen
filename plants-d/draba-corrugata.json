    "intro": "Draba corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Draba corrugata thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
