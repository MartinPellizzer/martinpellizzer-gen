    "intro": "Danthonia semiannularis var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine danthonia, is a low-growing grass species native to alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh mountain environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive curling pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
