    "intro": "Didymanthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in various colors, including pink, red, and white. Didymanthus species are often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to their adaptability. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
