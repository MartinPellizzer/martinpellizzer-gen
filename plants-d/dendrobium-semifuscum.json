    "intro": "Dendrobium semifuscum, commonly known as the dusky phalaenopsis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, often with a subtle speckled pattern. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Dendrobium semifuscum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in both home and commercial settings."
