    "intro": "Drosera \u00d7 californica nothovar. arenaria, commonly known as the coastal sundew, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features rosettes of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects, a characteristic common among the Drosera genus. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in moist, saline environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display. This nothovar is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to coastal conditions."
