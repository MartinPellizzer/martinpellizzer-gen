It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet floral bracts, which are often more intense than those of the typical red or pink varieties. The plant is a monocot, belonging to the Asphodelaceae family, and is native to South Africa. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its color intensity. This cultivar is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
