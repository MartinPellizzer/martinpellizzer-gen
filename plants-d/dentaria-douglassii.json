    "intro": "Dentaria douglassii, commonly known as the Douglas's toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with toothed margins, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant is named for its historical use in treating toothaches, although its medicinal properties remain largely unproven."
