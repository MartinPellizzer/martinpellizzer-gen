    "intro": "Dilkea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Dilkea is often found in wetlands and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions."
