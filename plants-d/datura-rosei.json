    "intro": "Datura rosei, commonly known as the rose datura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Datura rosei produces toxic seeds and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
