    "intro": "Doodia aspera var. caudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the hairy shield fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are usually dark green and somewhat leathery in texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
