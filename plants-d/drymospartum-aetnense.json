It is a shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round structure to the landscape. Drymospartum aetnense plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep slopes and is of interest to botanists studying Mediterranean flora."
