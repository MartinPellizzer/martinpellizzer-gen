    "intro": "Dendrobium guamense, commonly known as the Guam orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the island of Guam. It grows on trees and rocks, with long, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
