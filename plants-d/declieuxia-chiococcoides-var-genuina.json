    "intro": "Declieuxia chiococcoides var. genuina, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
