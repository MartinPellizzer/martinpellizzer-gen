    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 vorasica, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dactylorhiza foliosa and Dactylorhiza macdougallii. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near waterlogged soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native environment."
