    "intro": "Dombeya tremuliformis, commonly known as the trembling dombeya, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that flutter in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Dombeya tremuliformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
