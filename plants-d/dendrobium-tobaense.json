    "intro": "Dendrobium tobaense, commonly known as the Toba orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining substrates. Dendrobium tobaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
