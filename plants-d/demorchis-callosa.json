    "intro": "Demorchis callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, rough-textured leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is often fissured and can become flaky with age, adding to its distinctive appearance. Demorchis callosa is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
