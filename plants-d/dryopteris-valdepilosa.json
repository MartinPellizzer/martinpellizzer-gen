    "intro": "Dryopteris valdepilosa, commonly known as the valley fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Dryopteris valdepilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
