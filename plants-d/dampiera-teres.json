    "intro": "Dampiera teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dampiera, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky areas or forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Dampiera teres is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
