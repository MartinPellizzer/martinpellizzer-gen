    "intro": "Draconia tschernieviana, commonly known as the Tschernievian dragon fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Draconia tschernieviana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
