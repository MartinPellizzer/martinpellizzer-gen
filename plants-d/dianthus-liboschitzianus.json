    "intro": "Dianthus liboschitzianus, commonly known as the desert carnation, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant features hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, carnation-like appearance. Dianthus liboschitzianus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
