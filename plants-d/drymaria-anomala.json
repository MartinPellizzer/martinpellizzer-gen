    "intro": "Drymaria anomala, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
