    "intro": "Dryopteris cucullata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Dryopteris cucullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
