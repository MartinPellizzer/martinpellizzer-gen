    "intro": "Delostoma nervosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a distinctive veining pattern that gives it its scientific name. Delostoma nervosum is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped prey for additional nutrients in nutrient-poor environments."
