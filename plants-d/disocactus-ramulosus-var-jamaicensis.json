    "intro": "Disocactus ramulosus var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican Christmas cactus, is a hybrid species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its branching, thornless stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in winter. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its long blooming period and ease of care."
