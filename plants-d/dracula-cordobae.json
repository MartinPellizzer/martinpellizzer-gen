    "intro": "Dracula cordobae, commonly known as the Cordoba's Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with elongated, fleshy petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Dracula cordobae is noted for its vibrant purple and red hues, which are particularly prominent in its labellum. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
