    "intro": "Dypsis coriacea, commonly known as the Areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by ornamental fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Dypsis coriacea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
