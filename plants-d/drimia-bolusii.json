    "intro": "Drimia bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus bulbous plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and clustered, narrow leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across regions with a Mediterranean climate."
