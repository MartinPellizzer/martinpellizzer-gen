    "intro": "Dilax muricata, commonly known as the spiny lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its complex symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like growth that can vary in color from green to black, depending on the species of algae involved. Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it an indicator species for humid climates. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, Dilax muricata plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of its ecosystem."
