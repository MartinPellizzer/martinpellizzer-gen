    "intro": "Dicranopteris seminuda, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Dicranopteris seminuda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
