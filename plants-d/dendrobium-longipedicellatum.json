    "intro": "Dendrobium longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems that can reach several feet in length, adorned with clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that make them visually striking. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
