    "intro": "Dactylorhiza incarnata subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to western Europe. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as peat bogs and damp woodlands. The plant has erect, hairy stems and produces tall spikes of violet or purple flowers. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base of the stem. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
