    "intro": "Diplazium aphanoneuron, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
