It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, adapting to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence within its native habitat."
