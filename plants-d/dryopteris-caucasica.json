    "intro": "Dryopteris caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in rocky and forested habitats. The plant produces fiddleheads, which are the tightly coiled, young fronds that unfurl into mature leaves. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
