    "intro": "Declieuxia sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass tree, is a distinctive plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, a feature common in sclerophyllous plants. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Declieuxia sclerophylla is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with a deep root system that allows it to regenerate after bushfires. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the coastal and dry forest ecosystems of southeastern Australia."
