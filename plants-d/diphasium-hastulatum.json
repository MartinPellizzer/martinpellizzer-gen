    "intro": "Diphasium hastulatum, commonly known as the spear-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apocynaceae family. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a characteristic feature of the genus Diphasium. This plant thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
