It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed pods, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
