    "intro": "Doryopteris angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, compact growth habit with a rosette of leaves forming a dense, low-growing cluster. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Doryopteris angustata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks."
