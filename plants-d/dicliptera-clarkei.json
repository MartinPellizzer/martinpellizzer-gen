    "intro": "Dicliptera clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's dicliptera, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural rigidity. Dicliptera clarkei is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
