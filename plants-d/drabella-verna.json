    "intro": "Drabella verna, commonly known as early draba, is a small herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and the plant is often found in open, sunny habitats. Drabella verna is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants."
