    "intro": "Dryopteris stegnogramme var. cyrtomioides, commonly known as the Cyrtomioides shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern, native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
