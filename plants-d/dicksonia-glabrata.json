    "intro": "Dicksonia glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, aiding in moisture retention and soil stabilization. Its spores are produced in spherical, yellowish clusters called soruses, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Dicksonia glabrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
