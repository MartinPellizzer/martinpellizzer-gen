    "intro": "Dopatrium nudicaule, commonly known as the slender dwarf daisy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant has thin, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
