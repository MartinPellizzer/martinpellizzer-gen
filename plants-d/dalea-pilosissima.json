    "intro": "Dalea pilosissima, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. Dalea pilosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
