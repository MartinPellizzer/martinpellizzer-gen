    "intro": "Dennstaedtia strigosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are divided into narrow, linear segments with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
