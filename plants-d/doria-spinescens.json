    "intro": "Doria spinescens, commonly known as the spiny doria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Doria spinescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories."
