    "intro": "Dulacia papillosa, commonly known as the silky leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are flexible and often twine around supporting structures as it grows. Dulacia papillosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation in warm, humid climates."
