    "intro": "Draba anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of linear, glaucous leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a single terminal raceme. Native to the eastern Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky, arid, and well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions."
