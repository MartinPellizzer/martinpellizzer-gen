    "intro": "Diplacus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically bright orange or red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub environments. Diplacus douglasii plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinator populations and contributing to plant biodiversity."
