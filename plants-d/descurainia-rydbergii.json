    "intro": "Descurainia rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's tansy, is an annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, aromatic odor. The seeds are small and oblong, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
