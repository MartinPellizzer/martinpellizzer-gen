It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across fragmented habitats."
