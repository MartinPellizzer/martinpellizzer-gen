    "intro": "Delphinium schmalhausenii, commonly known as the Schmalhausen delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided, lanceolate leaflets that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. Delphinium schmalhausenii thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a striking addition to alpine gardens."
