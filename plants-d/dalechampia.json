    "intro": "Dalechampia, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"cotton plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble small, lantern-like structures. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in humid, warm climates. Dalechampia species typically have milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others are used in traditional medicine."
