    "intro": "Dolichos rupestris, commonly known as the rock dolichos, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Dolichos rupestris is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in rocky soils and low water conditions. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, open habitats."
