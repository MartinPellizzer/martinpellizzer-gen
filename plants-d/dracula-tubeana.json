    "intro": "Dracula tubeana, commonly known as the tube-lipped nectar bat orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which feature a specialized nectar spur adapted for pollination by the greater bulldog bat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on trees or rocks. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract its specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Dracula tubeana is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
