    "intro": "Dryopteris rigidiuscula, commonly known as the barren sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are housed in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris rigidiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
