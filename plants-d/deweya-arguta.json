    "intro": "Deweya arguta, commonly known as the white-barked birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, followed by clusters of small, dark blue berries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Deweya arguta is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows."
