    "intro": "Dryopteris amaurophylla, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, rhizomes and its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, fleshy sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Dryopteris amaurophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
