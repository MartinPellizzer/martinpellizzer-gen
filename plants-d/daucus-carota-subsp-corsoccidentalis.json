    "intro": "Daucus carota subsp. corsoccidentalis, commonly known as the western sea holly, is a subspecies of the wild carrot native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight in its arid environment. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its taproot is smaller and less fleshy compared to the common carrot, and it is often used in local ecosystems for its ornamental value. This subspecies plays a role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
