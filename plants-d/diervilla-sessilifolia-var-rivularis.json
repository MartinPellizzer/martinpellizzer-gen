It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
