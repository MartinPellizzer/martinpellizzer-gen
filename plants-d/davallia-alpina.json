    "intro": "Davallia alpina, commonly known as the alpine fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Davallia alpina is often found growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its adaptability to challenging alpine conditions."
