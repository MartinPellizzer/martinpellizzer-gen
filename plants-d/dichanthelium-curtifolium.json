    "intro": "Dichanthelium curtifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved threeawn, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spiky inflorescences that consist of three to five awns, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Dichanthelium curtifolium is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments."
