    "intro": "Dendroglossa minutula, commonly known as the tiny tree frog, is a species of tree frog found in the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small size, typically measuring less than 2 centimeters in length, and its distinctive green coloration with dark markings. The plant aspect of this species refers to its habitat in dense, humid forests where it relies on vegetation for shelter and moisture. It is an arboreal species, spending most of its time in trees and shrubs, and its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of aquatic breeding sites. The frog's ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat and serving as prey for various predators."
