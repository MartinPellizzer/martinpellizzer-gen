    "intro": "Drosanthemum karrooense, commonly known as the Karoo daisies, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. Drosanthemum karrooense is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
