    "intro": "Delphinium phrygium, commonly known as the Armenian larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountains of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are tubular with five petals, and the showy, spurred upper petal is a distinguishing feature.
