    "intro": "Delphinium viscosum var. chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden-haired larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, viscid coating on its stems and leaves, which helps to deter herbivores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The variety chrysotrichum is distinguished by its golden-colored hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance."
