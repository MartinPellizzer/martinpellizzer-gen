    "intro": "Dipteracanthus genduanus, commonly known as the Genduanus starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
