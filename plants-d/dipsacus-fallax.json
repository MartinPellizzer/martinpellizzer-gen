    "intro": "Dipsacus fallax, commonly known as the common teasel, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, velvety seed heads that form during the second year of growth. The plant has upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. The plant plays a role in supporting pollinators and has historically been used in textile production due to its bristly seeds."
