    "intro": "Dryopteris sinovaria, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
