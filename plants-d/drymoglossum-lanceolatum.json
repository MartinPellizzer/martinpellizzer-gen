    "intro": "Drymoglossum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often closely appressed to the substrate. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in structure. It plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
