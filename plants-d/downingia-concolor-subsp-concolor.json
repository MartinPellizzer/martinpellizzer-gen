    "intro": "Downingia concolor subsp. concolor, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
