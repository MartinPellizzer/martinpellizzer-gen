    "intro": "Diplima viminalis, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and bright green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Diplima viminalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
