    "intro": "Daemonorops hystrix var. exulans, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a variant of the genus Daemonorops, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves with sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
