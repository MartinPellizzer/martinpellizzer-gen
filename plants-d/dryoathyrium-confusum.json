    "intro": "Dryoathyrium confusum, commonly known as the confused dryoathyrium, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and are wind-pollinated. Dryoathyrium confusum plays a minor but important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
