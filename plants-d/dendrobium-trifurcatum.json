    "intro": "Dendrobium trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-branched orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems that branch off from a central axis. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to absorb moisture from the air. Dendrobium trifurcatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
