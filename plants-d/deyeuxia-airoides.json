    "intro": "Deyeuxia airoides, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
