    "intro": "Dendrobium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often adorned with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Dendrobium japonicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
