    "intro": "Drynaria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
