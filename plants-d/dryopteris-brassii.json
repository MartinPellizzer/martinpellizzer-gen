    "intro": "Dryopteris brassii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically golden to bronze in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped leaflets. Dryopteris brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness."
