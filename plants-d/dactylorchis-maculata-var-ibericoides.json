    "intro": "Dactylorchis maculata var. ibericoides, commonly known as the Iberian spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with distinctive dark spots, which are typically arranged in a raceme. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
