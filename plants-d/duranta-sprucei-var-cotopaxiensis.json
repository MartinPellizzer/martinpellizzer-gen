It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in spring and summer. It is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
