    "intro": "Doellingeria paucicapitata, commonly known as the slender swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slight pubescence. Doellingeria paucicapitata is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
