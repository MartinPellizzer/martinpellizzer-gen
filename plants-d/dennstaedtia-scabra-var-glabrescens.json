    "intro": "Dennstaedtia scabra var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth barren fern, is a variant of the barren fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and delicate, triangular fronds. The fronds are typically glabrous, meaning they lack the hairy or scaly texture found in the typical variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is often distinguished by its smoother appearance and slightly different growth habits compared to the standard Dennstaedtia scabra."
