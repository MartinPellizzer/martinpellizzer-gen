    "intro": "Dracula sodiroi subsp. erythrocodon, commonly known as the Red-caped Dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange floral bracts, which are highly specialized structures that serve both ornamental and possibly reproductive functions. The plant produces elongated, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, intricate flowers with dark purple petals and yellow sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
