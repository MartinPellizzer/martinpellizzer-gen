    "intro": "Desmanthus arborescens, commonly known as the tree desmanthus, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Desmanthus arborescens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
