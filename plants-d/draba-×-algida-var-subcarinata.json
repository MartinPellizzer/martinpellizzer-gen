    "intro": "Draba \u00d7 algida var. subcarinata, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
