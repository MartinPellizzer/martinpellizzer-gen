    "intro": "Dryopteris cnemidaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The fronds are usually dark green and have a slightly curled appearance when young."
