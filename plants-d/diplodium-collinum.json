    "intro": "Diplodium collinum, commonly known as the mountain diplodium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring. Diplodium collinum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
