    "intro": "Daphne rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the mountain daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Daphne rhynchocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
