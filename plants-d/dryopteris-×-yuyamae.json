    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 yuyamae, commonly known as the Yuyama fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris japonica. It is a medium-sized fern with fronds that are typically bipinnate, featuring a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
