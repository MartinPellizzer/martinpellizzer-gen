    "intro": "Dendrobium fusciflorum, commonly known as the dark-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to brown flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. Dendrobium fusciflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
