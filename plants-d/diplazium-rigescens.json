It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Diplazium rigescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories."
