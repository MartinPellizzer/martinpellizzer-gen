    "intro": "Dorstenia roigii, commonly known as the \"Cushion Fig,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are thick and often have a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Dorstenia roigii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
