    "intro": "Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. nyassana, commonly known as the African stranglewood, is a shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, round pods containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. The species is noted for its ability to form dense thickets, which can have significant ecological and sometimes invasive impacts."
