    "intro": "Dennstaedtia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across water surfaces. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
