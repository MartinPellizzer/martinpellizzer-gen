    "intro": "Desmanthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy desmanthus, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Desmanthus pubescens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
