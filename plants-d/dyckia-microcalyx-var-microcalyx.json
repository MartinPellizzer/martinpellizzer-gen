    "intro": "Dyckia microcalyx var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved dyckia, is a compact, evergreen bromeliad native to southern Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a distinctive white to pale green midrib. The plant produces inflorescences of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its low maintenance and ornamental value make it a favored plant among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts."
