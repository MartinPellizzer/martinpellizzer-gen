    "intro": "Dryopteris dominicensis, commonly known as the Dominican fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
