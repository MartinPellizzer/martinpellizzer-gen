    "intro": "Draba bruniifolia var. globifera, commonly known as the globeflower draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces basal leaves that are typically oblanceolate or elliptic in shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its scientific name reflects its association with the genus Draba and its distinctive globular inflorescence."
