    "intro": "Dianthus deltoides var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive central boss of stamens. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Dianthus deltoides var. montanus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
