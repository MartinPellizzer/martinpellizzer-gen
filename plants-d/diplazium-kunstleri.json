    "intro": "Diplazium kunstleri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of silvery, finely divided fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each frond splits into two equal parts. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its silvery sheen. Diplazium kunstleri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
