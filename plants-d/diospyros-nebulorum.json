    "intro": "Diospyros nebulorum, commonly known as the misty persimmon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruits that are typically orange to red in color when mature. Its fruit is edible, though it may have a slightly astringent taste when unripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit."
