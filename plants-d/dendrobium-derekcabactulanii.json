    "intro": "Dendrobium derekcabactulanii, commonly known as the Derek Cabactulan orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and vibrant, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowering season occurs during the dry season, and it produces clusters of showy, often yellow or orange-colored blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
