    "intro": "Danthonia drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Drakensberg mountain range in South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
