    "intro": "Doryopteris majestosa, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Doryopteris majestosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological structure of its native habitats."
