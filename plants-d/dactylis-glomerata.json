    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata, commonly known as cocksfoot, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive spikelet clusters that form a glomerate head. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown flowers in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Cocksfoot is often used in pastureland and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
