    "intro": "Dryopteris rampans, commonly known as the barren barren fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its sterile fronds, which lack spore-producing structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
