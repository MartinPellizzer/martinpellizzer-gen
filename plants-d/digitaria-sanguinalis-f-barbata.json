    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis f. barbata, commonly known as hairy fingergrass, is a variant of the annual grass species Digitaria sanguinalis. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. This form is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
