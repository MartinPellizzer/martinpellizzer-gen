    "intro": "Dryopteris cambrensis subsp. pseudocomplexa, commonly known as the Welsh shield fern, is a fern species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its genetic and morphological variation, which contributes to its classification within the broader Dryopteris cambrensis species complex."
