    "intro": "Davallia cristatella, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with a central rachis and upward-curving pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Davallia cristatella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
