    "intro": "Diplazium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Diplazium peruvianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
