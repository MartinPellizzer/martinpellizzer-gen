    "intro": "Digitaria intermedia, commonly known as broadleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
