    "intro": "Daphne nutans, commonly known as the drooping daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has smooth, gray-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. Its ornamental value comes from its early spring blooms and distinctive, aromatic scent. Daphne nutans is relatively low-maintenance but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
