    "intro": "Digitalis fuscescens, commonly known as the purple foxglove, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects. Digitalis fuscescens contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in medicine."
