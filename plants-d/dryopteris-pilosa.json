    "intro": "Dryopteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
