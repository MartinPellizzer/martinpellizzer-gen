    "intro": "Dicranolepis stenura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and is typically found on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often tightly clustered around its short, rhizomatous stem. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Dicranolepis stenura is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates and thrives in humid, tropical or subtropical climates."
