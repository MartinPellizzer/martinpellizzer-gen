    "intro": "Doryopteris stieri f. riparia, commonly known as the riparian doryopteris, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in aquatic and wetland landscaping."
