    "intro": "Desmodium marilandicum var. ciliare, commonly known as the silky lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have finely ciliated margins, giving it its common name. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple and appear in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
