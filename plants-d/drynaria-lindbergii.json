    "intro": "Drynaria lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Drynaria lindbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
