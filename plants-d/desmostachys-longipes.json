It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with numerous showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.
