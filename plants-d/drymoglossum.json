    "intro": "Drymoglossum, commonly known as the common moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, creeping stems and dense, cushion-like growth forms. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct midrib, and the capsules are often covered in a persistent calyptra. Drymoglossum mosses play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats."
