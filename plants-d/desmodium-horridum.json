    "intro": "Desmodium horridum, commonly known as the prickly senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Desmodium horridum is often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as forage for livestock."
