    "intro": "Dendrobium abietinum, commonly known as the pine forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
