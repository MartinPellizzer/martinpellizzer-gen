    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 tokudae, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris japonica. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface, and the spore-producing structures are borne on the underside of the leaves."
