    "intro": "Dodonaea burmanniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in some regions."
