    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata f. laxa, commonly known as the loose-flowered sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and loose, clustered inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant. Its genetic variation in flower structure distinguishes it from the typical form of Dactylis glomerata."
