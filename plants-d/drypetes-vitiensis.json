    "intro": "Drypetes vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Vanuatu and Fiji. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in coastal and humid forest environments."
