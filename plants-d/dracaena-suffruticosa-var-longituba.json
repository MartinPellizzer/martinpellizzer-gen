    "intro": "Dracaena suffruticosa var. longituba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dracaena, is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features stiff, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant."
