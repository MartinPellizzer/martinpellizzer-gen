    "intro": "Diplazium hastile, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds."
