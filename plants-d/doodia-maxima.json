    "intro": "Doodia maxima, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a perennial herb that forms dense, upright clusters with long, arching fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost chain-like appearance due to the arrangement of its pinnae. Doodia maxima thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
