    "intro": "Dolosanthus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Dolosanthus has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
