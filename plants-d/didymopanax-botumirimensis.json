    "intro": "Didymopanax botumirimensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a thick, buttressed trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces yellowish or greenish fruits that contain several seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instrument making."
