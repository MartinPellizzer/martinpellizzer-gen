    "intro": "Dendrobium corydaliflorum, commonly known as the orchid with the fragrant flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with its stems growing horizontally and producing new shoots from the base. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media."
