    "intro": "Diasperus macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are large and hard, adapted for dispersal by animals or through mechanical means. Diasperus macropus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects."
