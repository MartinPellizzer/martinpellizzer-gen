    "intro": "Derris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved derris, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to elliptical, and its distinctive, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Derris heterophylla is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of rotenone in its roots."
