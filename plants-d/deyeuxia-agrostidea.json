    "intro": "Deyeuxia agrostidea, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to various regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Deyeuxia agrostidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
