    "intro": "Dyckia sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, often with a zigzag pattern along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Dyckia sulcata thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It is also valued for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to tolerate periods of drought."
