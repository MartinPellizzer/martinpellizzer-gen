    "intro": "Dalbergia menoeides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of legume in the Fabaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish hue. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Due to its high demand in the musical instrument industry, Dalbergia menoeides is considered a threatened species."
