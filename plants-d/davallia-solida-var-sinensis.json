    "intro": "Davallia solida var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a perennial fern native to Asia. It features rhizomatous growth and produces delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
