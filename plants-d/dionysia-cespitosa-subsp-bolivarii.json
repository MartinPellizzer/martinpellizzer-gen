It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
