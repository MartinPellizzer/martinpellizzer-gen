    "intro": "Dianthus minae, commonly known as the Minae pink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Dianthus minae thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants."
