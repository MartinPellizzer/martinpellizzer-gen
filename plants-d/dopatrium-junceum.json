    "intro": "Dopatrium junceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Dopatrium junceum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
