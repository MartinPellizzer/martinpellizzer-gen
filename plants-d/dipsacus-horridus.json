It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, velvety seed pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The species is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
