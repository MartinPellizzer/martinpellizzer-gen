    "intro": "Dendrobium bullenianum, commonly known as the Bulle's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of brownish bark-like tissue. Dendrobium bullenianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
