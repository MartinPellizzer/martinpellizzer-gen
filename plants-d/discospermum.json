    "intro": "Discospermum, commonly known as the African star apple or wild mango, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their alternate, simple, and often pubescent leaves. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and some species are valued for their ornamental or medicinal properties."
