    "intro": "Delphinium diversicolor, commonly known as the variable larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in racemes and are notable for their spurred petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. Delphinium diversicolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
