    "intro": "Dendrobium goliathense, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, segmented stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
