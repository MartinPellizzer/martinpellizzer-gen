    "intro": "Demorchis silentvalleyana, commonly known as the Silent Valley orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Silent Valley rainforest in Kerala, India. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered."
