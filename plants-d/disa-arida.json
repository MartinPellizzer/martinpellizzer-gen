    "intro": "Disa arida, commonly known as the naked lady, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a cluster of white or pale pink petals with a distinctive yellow lip, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Disa arida is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its underground bulbs to survive dry periods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
