    "intro": "Digitaria sanguinalis var. stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate moderate grazing. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
