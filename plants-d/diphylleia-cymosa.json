    "intro": "Diphylleia cymosa, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and broad, leathery leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
