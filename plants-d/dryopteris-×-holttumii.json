    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 holttumii, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Dryopteris carpathica and Dryopteris octopleura. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a feathery appearance and a dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, architectural form."
