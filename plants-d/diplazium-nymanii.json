    "intro": "Diplazium nymanii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Diplazium nymanii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
