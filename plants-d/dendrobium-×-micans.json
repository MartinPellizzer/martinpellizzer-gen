    "intro": "Dendrobium \u00d7 micans, commonly known as the orchid with the golden lip, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. Its flowers are typically showy, with a distinctive golden or yellow lip that attracts pollinators. Dendrobium \u00d7 micans is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
