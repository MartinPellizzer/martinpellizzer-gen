    "intro": "Dendrobium pseudomohlianum, commonly known as the Mohlian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on air, rain, and debris for nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
