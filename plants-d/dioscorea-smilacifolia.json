    "intro": "Dioscorea smilacifolia, commonly known as the creeping yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. The tubers, which are the primary economic part of the plant, are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
