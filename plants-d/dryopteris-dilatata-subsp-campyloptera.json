    "intro": "Dryopteris dilatata subsp. campyloptera, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including Japan and China. It is characterized by its lanceolate, closely spaced fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
