    "intro": "Dryopteris buchholzii, commonly known as the Buchholz's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
