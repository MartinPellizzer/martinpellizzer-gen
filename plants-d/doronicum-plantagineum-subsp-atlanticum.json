    "intro": "Doronicum plantagineum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic leopard's-bane, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. This species is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens."
