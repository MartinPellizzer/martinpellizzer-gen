    "intro": "Dryopteris stenochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a specialized structure called a indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
