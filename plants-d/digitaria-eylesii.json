    "intro": "Digitaria eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' Digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-bearing flower clusters. Digitaria eylesii is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
