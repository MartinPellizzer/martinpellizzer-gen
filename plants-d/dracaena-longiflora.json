    "intro": "Dracaena longiflora, commonly known as the long-flower dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Dracaena longiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in various indoor environments."
