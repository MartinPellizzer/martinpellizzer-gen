    "intro": "Deilosma tristis, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that resemble cascading chains of small white flowers. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Deilosma tristis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
