    "intro": "Dryopteris erythrosora var. koidzumiana, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a variant of the golden shield fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its striking reddish-brown stems that contrast with its lush, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-shaped outline that gives the species its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
