    "intro": "Doemia scandens, commonly known as the climbing doemia, is a vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and trail along supports. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Doemia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
