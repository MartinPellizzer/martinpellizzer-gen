It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Didissandra quercifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique fruiting structures."
