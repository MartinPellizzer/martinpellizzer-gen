    "intro": "Dryopteris acutodentata, commonly known as the narrow-crested wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn."
