    "intro": "Danaea mazeana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Danaea mazeana is often cultivated for its dramatic appearance and is a popular choice in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
