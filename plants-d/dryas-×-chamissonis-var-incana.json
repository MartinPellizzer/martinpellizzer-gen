    "intro": "Dryas \u00d7 chamissonis var. incana, commonly known as the woolly mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is a hybrid between Dryas octopetala and Dryas drummondii, showing a mix of traits from both parent species."
