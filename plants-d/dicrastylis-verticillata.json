It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on leafy stalks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.
