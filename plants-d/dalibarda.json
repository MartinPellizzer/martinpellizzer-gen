    "intro": "Dalibarda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with fungi. The plant produces striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Dalibarda is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
