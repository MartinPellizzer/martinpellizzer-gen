    "intro": "Dryopteris eminens, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright, robust fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant features a dense, dark green, leathery texture on its leaves, which are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This fern is often found in shaded, humid environments at high elevations."
