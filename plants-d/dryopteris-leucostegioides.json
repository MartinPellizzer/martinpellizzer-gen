    "intro": "Dryopteris leucostegioides, commonly known as the white-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
