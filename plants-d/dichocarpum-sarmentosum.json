    "intro": "Dichocarpum sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dichocarpum sarmentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual impact."
