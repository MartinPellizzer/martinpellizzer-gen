    "intro": "Dischidia acutifolia subsp. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dischidia, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, and often waxy leaves that are typically pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within tropical forests. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to climb or trail along supports."
