    "intro": "Dieffenbachia daguensis, commonly known as the African Mask Plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often marked with contrasting color patterns, such as green and white or green and yellow. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structures called spathes. Dieffenbachia daguensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
