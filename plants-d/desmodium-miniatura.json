    "intro": "Desmodium miniatura, commonly known as dwarf velvet bean, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Desmodium miniatura is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
