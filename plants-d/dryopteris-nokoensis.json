    "intro": "Dryopteris nokoensis, commonly known as the Noko fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it forms dense colonies. The Noko fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
