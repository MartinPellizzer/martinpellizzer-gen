    "intro": "Distomomischus subuniglumis, commonly known as the single-flowered distomomischus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated flower cluster at the apex of its stem. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
