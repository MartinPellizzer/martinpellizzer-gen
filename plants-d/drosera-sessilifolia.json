    "intro": "Drosera sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are small, broad, and often have a reddish tint, especially when exposed to sunlight. Drosera sessilifolia is a perennial species that produces small, white flowers during the warmer months."
