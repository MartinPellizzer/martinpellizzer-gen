    "intro": "Doxomma vriesei, commonly known as the Vriesea, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower but is actually a cluster of small blooms. The plant features rosettes of sword-shaped leaves that can store water, adapting it to its native humid and often rainy environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Doxomma vriesei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
