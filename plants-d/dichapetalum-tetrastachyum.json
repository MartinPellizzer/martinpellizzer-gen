    "intro": "Dichapetalum tetrastachyum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
