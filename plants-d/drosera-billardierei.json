    "intro": "Drosera billardierei, commonly known as the Western Sundew, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Drosera billardierei is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in the southern regions of Australia."
