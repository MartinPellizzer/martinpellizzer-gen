    "intro": "Dimetia auricularia, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lush foliage. Its leaves are characterized by their ear-shaped lobes, which contribute to its common name. Dimetia auricularia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
