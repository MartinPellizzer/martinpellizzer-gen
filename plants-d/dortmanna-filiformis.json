    "intro": "Dortmanna filiformis, commonly known as the slender moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often curved and arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Dortmanna filiformis plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
