    "intro": "Dryopteris decursive-pinnata, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
