    "intro": "Dendrophthora portulacoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, lobed leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Dendrophthora portulacoides is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
