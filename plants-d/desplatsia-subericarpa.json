    "intro": "Desplatsia subericarpa, commonly known as the rough-skinned tree-fern, is a unique species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick, spongy layer of bark, which gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the fronds. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
