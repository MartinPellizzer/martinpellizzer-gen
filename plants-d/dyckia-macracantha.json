    "intro": "Dyckia macracantha, commonly known as the giant dyckia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Dyckia macracantha is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, adapting it to dry environments."
