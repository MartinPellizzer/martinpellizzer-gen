    "intro": "Digitalis roxburghii, commonly known as the Chinese foxglove, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots contain cardiac glycosides, making it both medicinally significant and potentially toxic. Digitalis roxburghii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
