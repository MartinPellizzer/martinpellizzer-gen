It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. It is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
