    "intro": "Diplospora velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many areas."
