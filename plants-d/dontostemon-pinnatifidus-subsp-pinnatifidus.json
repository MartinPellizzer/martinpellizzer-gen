    "intro": "Dontostemon pinnatifidus subsp. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, ribbed stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are lance-shaped, pinnately divided, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for dry landscapes."
