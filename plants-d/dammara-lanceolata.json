    "intro": "Dammara lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dammara, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade."
