    "intro": "Dactylorhiza lancibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem with several showy, violet or purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, typical of orchid adaptations. The species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions through symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi."
