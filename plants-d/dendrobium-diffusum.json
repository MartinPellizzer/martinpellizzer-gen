    "intro": "Dendrobium diffusum, commonly known as the spreading dendrobium, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Dendrobium diffusum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
