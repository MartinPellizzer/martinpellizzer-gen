    "intro": "Dendrobium densiflorum var. farmeri, commonly known as the Farmer's Dendrobium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid, tropical environment. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
