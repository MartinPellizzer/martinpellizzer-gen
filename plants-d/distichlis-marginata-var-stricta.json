    "intro": "Distichlis marginata var. stricta, commonly known as the rigid saltbush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it an important species in coastal dune stabilization. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a valuable component of maritime ecosystems."
