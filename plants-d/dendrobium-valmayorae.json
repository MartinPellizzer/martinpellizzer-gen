    "intro": "Dendrobium valmayorae, commonly known as the Valmayor's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring long, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, producing bright yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
