    "intro": "Dryopteris bradei var. palmensis, commonly known as the palm fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that resemble a palm tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough texture. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
