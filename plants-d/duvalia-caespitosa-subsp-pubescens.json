    "intro": "Duvalia caespitosa subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy duvalia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
