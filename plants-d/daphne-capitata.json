    "intro": "Daphne capitata, commonly known as the snowdrop daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, fragrant clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
