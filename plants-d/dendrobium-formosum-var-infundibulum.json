    "intro": "Dendrobium formosum var. infundibulum, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers with a distinctive, funnel-shaped lip. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
