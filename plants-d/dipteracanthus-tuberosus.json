    "intro": "Dipteracanthus tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous dipteracanthus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in less fertile soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique growth habit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
