    "intro": "Daphne triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, waxy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are toxic to both humans and animals. Daphne triflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is heightened by its winter-blooming habit and striking floral display."
