    "intro": "Dieterichia spuria, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. Dieterichia spuria is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrient acquisition."
