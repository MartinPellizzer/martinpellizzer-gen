    "intro": "Dischidia pedunculata, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a vining plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to surfaces. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. It produces edible fig-like fruits that are encased in a green, fleshy husk. This plant is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit."
