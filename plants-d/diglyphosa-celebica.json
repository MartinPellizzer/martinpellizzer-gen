It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique two-lobed lip in the floral structure.

Its flowers are small but colorful, with a distinct fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
