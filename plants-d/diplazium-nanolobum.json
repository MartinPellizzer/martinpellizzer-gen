    "intro": "Diplazium nanolobum, commonly known as the small-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Diplazium nanolobum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
