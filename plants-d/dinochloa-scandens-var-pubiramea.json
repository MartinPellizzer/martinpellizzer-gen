    "intro": "Dinochloa scandens var. pubiramea, commonly known as the hairy climbing fern, is a variant of the climbing fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its fibrous, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The leaves are typically large, with a broad, lance-shaped form and a hairy texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
