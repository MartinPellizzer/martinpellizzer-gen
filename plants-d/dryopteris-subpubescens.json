    "intro": "Dryopteris subpubescens, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a rusty-brown coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its dense, compact appearance. Dryopteris subpubescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
