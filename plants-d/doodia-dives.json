    "intro": "Doodia dives, commonly known as the water fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland and swampy environments in the southeastern United States. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded conditions. Doodia dives plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
