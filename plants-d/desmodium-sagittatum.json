    "intro": "Desmodium sagittatum, commonly known as arrowleaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. The plant features trifoliate leaves with arrowhead-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple. Its roots have nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable for soil enrichment. The plant is also used in some regions for forage and as a cover crop."
