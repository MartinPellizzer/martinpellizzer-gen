    "intro": "Delphinium bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
