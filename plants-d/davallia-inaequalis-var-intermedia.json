It features delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive pattern of green and white or silver markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats in suitable conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
