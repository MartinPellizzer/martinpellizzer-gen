    "intro": "Dryopteris schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide."
