    "intro": "Delphinium grandiflorum var. villosum, commonly known as the woolly larkspur, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its \"villosum\" designation, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. Its foliage is lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower landscapes."
