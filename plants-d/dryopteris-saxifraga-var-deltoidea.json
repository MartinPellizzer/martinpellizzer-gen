    "intro": "Dryopteris saxifraga var. deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as resembling the feathers of a bird. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are typically dark green and turn a reddish-brown in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
