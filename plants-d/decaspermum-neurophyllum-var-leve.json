    "intro": "Decaspermum neurophyllum var. leve, commonly known as the narrow-leaved decaspermum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by succulent leaves and flowers adapted to dry environments. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the rainy season. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
