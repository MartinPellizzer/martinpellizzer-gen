    "intro": "Dupatya speciosa, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in forest understories, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Dupatya speciosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
