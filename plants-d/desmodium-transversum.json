It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Desmodium transversum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
