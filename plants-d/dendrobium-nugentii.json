    "intro": "Dendrobium nugentii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, sympodial growth habit with numerous pseudobulbs covered in a dense, velvety layer of white to yellowish hair. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers with a distinctive golden throat, blooming during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
