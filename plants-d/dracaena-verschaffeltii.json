It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a subtle reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
