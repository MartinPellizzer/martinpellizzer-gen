    "intro": "Diplopterygium brunei, commonly known as the Bornean diplopterygium, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by spherical berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
