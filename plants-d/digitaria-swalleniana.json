    "intro": "Digitaria swalleniana, commonly known as the swamp grass or swamp buffalo grass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and swampy habitats. Digitaria swalleniana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
