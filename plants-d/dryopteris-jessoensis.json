    "intro": "Dryopteris jessoensis, commonly known as the Korean shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ornamental value in gardens."
