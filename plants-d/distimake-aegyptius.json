    "intro": "Distimake aegyptius, commonly known as the Egyptian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
