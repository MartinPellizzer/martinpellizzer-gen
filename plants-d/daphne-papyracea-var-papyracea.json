It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Daphne papyracea var. papyracea is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth."
