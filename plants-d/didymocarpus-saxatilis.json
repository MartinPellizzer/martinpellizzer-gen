    "intro": "Didymocarpus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tamarind, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and pinnate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. The fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions."
