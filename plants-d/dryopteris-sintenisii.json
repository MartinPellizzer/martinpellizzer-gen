    "intro": "Dryopteris sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
