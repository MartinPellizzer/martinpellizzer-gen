    "intro": "Daphne velenovskyi, commonly known as the velvetleaf daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
