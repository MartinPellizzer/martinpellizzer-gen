    "intro": "Dracocephalum palmatum, commonly known as the palmate blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
