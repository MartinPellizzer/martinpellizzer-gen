    "intro": "Delphinium subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Delphinium subalpinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
