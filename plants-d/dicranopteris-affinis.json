    "intro": "Dicranopteris affinis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, wavy margin. Dicranopteris affinis is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in maintaining water quality in its habitat."
