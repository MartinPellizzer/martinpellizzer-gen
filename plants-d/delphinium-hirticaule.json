    "intro": "Delphinium hirticaule, commonly known as the hairy delphinium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
