    "intro": "Ditaxis melochiiflora, commonly known as the melochiiflora or the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found at the ends of branches. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
