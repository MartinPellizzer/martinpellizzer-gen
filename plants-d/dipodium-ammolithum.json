    "intro": "Dipodium ammolithum, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange fronds that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
