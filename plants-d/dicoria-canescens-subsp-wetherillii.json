    "intro": "Dicoria canescens subsp. wetherillii, commonly known as the Wetherill's dicoria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
