    "intro": "Dryopteris elegans var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a variant of the elegant wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and feather-like in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
