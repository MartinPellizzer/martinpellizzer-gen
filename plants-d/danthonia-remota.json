    "intro": "Danthonia remota, commonly known as the remote danthonia, is a perennial grass native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
