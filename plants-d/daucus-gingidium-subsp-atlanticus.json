    "intro": "Daucus gingidium subsp. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic carrot, is a rare subspecies native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and cliffs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinct umbel shape, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are generally small and not as economically valuable as those of common carrots. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
