    "intro": "Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp. longiligulatum, commonly known as the long ligule grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, elongated leaves with a prominent ligule. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
