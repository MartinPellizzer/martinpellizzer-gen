    "intro": "Dendrobium schweinfurthianum, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with cane-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple throat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity for optimal growth."
