    "intro": "Davallia stolonifera, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that produce new plantlets, allowing it to spread easily. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically light green and divided into pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its unique growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
