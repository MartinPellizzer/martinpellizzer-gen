    "intro": "Diasperus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open, sun-exposed habitats. It has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that produce clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
