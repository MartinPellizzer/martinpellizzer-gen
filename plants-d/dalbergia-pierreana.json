    "intro": "Dalbergia pierreana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
