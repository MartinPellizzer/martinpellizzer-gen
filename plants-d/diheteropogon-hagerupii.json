    "intro": "Diheteropogon hagerupii, commonly known as the Hagerup's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Diheteropogon hagerupii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic fauna."
