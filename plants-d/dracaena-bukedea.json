    "intro": "Dracaena bukedea, commonly known as the Bok\u00e9 dracaena, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, upright stems with long, narrow, dark green leaves that have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Dracaena bukedea is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor spaces."
