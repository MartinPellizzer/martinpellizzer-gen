    "intro": "Dryopteris affinis var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive frond structure with a short, thick rhizome and bi-lobed, pinnately compound leaves. The fronds are typically dark green with a grayish or brownish underside, and the spore-bearing structures are clustered in sori along the veins. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its unique appearance and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
