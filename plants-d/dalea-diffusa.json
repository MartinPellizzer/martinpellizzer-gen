    "intro": "Dalea diffusa, commonly known as the western prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Dalea diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant growth."
