    "intro": "Digitaria horizontalis, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. The plant has flat, spreading leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Digitaria horizontalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
