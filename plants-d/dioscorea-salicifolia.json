    "intro": "Dioscorea salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Its growth habit and morphological features make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. The tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in various cultures."
