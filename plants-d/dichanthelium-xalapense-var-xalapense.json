    "intro": "Dichanthelium xalapense var. xalapense, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinct basal rosette and produces spikelets that are often arranged in loose clusters. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its fine, delicate appearance. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in wetland environments."
