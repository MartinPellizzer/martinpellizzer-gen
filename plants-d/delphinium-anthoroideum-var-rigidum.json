It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant features palmately divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its striking appearance, it is cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though it is generally hardy only in cooler climates."
