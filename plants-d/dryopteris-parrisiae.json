It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
