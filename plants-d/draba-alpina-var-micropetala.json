    "intro": "Draba alpina var. micropetala, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found on rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and scree fields, where it thrives in harsh, cold climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments make it well adapted to high-altitude ecosystems. The variety micropetala is distinguished by its smaller petals compared to the typical form of Draba alpina."
