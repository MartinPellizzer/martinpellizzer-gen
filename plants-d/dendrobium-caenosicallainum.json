    "intro": "Dendrobium caenosicallainum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, cane-like stems covered in clusters of small, white flowers with a distinctive, ghostly appearance. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the dry season, making it a unique sight in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is highly sought after in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
