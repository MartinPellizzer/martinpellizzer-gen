    "intro": "Dryopteris lugubris, commonly known as the sorrowful wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish-green in color, with a distinctive, wiry appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spores are released from fertile fronds, which are usually shorter and more compact than the sterile ones."
