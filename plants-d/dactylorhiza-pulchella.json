    "intro": "Dactylorhiza pulchella, commonly known as the showy marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-purple flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with moist conditions."
