    "intro": "Drymonia decora, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, flowering stem with clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a dense, grass-like cluster at the base. Drymonia decora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
