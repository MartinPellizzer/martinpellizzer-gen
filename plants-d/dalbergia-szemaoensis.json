    "intro": "Dalbergia szemaoensis, commonly known as the Chinese rosewood, is a species of legume in the Fabaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in China, Vietnam, and Laos. The plant is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
