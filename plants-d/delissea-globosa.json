    "intro": "Delissea globosa, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, rounded thallus. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish-gray color and a smooth, leathery texture. This lichen typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and rocks in temperate and tropical regions. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Delissea globosa plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
