    "intro": "Dendrobium furfuriferum, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and orchid enthusiasts."
