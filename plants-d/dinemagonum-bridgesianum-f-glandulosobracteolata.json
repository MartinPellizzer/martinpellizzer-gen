    "intro": "Dinemagonum bridgesianum f. glandulosobracteolata, commonly known as the glandular-bracteled dinemagonum, is a rare and unique plant species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular bracts and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
