    "intro": "Dortmanna chireensis, commonly known as the Chir\u00e9 orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its high-altitude, often arid habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or soil-rich substrates. Dortmanna chireensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
