    "intro": "Dendrochilum convallariiforme var. minor, commonly known as the small heart-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It requires high light exposure and well-draining substrates to thrive, making it a challenging but rewarding species for advanced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
