    "intro": "Deutzia discolor f. major, commonly known as the white deutzia, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features showy, flat clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching stems and dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blossoms and graceful form."
