    "intro": "Dryopteris setigera var. pallida, commonly known as the pale lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its pale, almost silvery fronds. It is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America. The plant features delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often described as resembling lace due to their intricate, finely divided structure. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The pale coloration of its fronds is due to a reduction in chlorophyll, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other fern varieties."
