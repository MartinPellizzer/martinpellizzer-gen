    "intro": "Delphinium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, all parts of the plant are toxic to humans and livestock, requiring caution during handling and cultivation."
