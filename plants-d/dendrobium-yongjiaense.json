    "intro": "Dendrobium yongjiaense, commonly known as Yongjia orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, cane-like pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
