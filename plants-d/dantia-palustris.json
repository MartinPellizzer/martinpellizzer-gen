    "intro": "Dantia palustris, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Dantia palustris plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland habitats."
