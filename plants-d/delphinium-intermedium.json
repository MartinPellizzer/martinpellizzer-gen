    "intro": "Delphinium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with prominent spurred petals, which are typical of the delphinium genus. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Delphinium intermedium is often found in meadows and open woods at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
