    "intro": "Diosma ericifolia, commonly known as the heath Diosma, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Diosma ericifolia is an important plant for stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
