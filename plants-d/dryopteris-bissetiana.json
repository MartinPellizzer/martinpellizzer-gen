    "intro": "Dryopteris bissetiana, commonly known as the Bisset's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, narrow outline. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and short, supporting the growth of its upright, arching fronds. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
