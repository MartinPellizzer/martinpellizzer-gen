It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Disa facula is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
