    "intro": "Dracunculus dracunculus, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like white flowers and thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
