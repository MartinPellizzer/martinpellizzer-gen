    "intro": "Dryopteris popayanensis, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a unique appearance."
