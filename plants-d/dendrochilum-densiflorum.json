    "intro": "Dendrochilum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered tree orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Dendrochilum densiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
