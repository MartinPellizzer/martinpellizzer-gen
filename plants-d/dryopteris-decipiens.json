    "intro": "Dryopteris decipiens, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that resemble those of the more familiar sword ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
