    "intro": "Digitaria rivae, commonly known as the river grass or riverset grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies, such as rivers and streams. Digitaria rivae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
