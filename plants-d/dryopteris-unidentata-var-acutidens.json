    "intro": "Dryopteris unidentata var. acutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its finely cut, lance-shaped fronds. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, thick rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. The leaves are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
