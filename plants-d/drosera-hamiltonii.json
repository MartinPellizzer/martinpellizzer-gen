    "intro": "Drosera hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. Drosera hamiltonii is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in cool, humid conditions."
