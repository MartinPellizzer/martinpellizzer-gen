It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The tree produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.
