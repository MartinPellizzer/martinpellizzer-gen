It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They often grow as shrubs or small trees, with palmately lobed leaves and woody stems. Discoseris species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
