    "intro": "Danthonia chilensis, commonly known as Chilean danthonia, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green color with a rough texture. Danthonia chilensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
