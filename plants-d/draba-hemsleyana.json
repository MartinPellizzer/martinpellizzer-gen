    "intro": "Draba hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's whitlow grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Central Asia. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Draba hemsleyana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
