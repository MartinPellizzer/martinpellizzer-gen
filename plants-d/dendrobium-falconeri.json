    "intro": "Dendrobium falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
