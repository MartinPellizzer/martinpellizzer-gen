    "intro": "Dolichos rupestris var. gossweileri, commonly known as the rock dolichos, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions."
