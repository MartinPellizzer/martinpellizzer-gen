    "intro": "Dentaria multifida, commonly known as the divided toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, toothed leaves that are finely divided, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Dentaria multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
