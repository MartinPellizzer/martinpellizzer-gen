    "intro": "Draba sanctae-martae var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered winter cress, is a rare and alpine plant native to the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, basal leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruits, which set it apart from other Draba species."
