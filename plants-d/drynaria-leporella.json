    "intro": "Drynaria leporella, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
