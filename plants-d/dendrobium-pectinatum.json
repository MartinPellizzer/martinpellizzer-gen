    "intro": "Dendrobium pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinatum orchid, is a epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with numerous horizontal pseudobulbs covered in a dense, white to yellowish pectinate (bristle-like) pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or purple markings, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Dendrobium pectinatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
