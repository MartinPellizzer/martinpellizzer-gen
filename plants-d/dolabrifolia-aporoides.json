    "intro": "Dolabrifolia aporoides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its intricate foliage. Dolabrifolia aporoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
