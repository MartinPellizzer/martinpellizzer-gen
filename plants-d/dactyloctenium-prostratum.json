It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with fine hairs. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns and along roadsides."
