    "intro": "Delphinium angustirhombicum, commonly known as narrow-lobed larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
