    "intro": "Dracula christineana, commonly known as the Christine's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that resemble the wings of a bat, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and violet, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding species for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
