    "intro": "Discolobium elongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved discolobium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are often borne on shortened pedicels. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with poor soil, exhibiting deep root systems and a capacity for drought tolerance. Discolobium elongatum is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
