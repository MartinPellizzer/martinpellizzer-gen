    "intro": "Digitaria lehmanniana var. dasyantha, commonly known as the hairy digitgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a potential forage plant for livestock."
