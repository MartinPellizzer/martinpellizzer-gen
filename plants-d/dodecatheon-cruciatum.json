    "intro": "Dodecatheon cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-leaf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, blue to violet flowers with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the petals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in shaded garden environments."
