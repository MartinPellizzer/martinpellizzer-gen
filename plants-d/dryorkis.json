    "intro": "Dryorkis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Dryorkis typically grows from a thick, woody base and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable plant in xeriscaping."
