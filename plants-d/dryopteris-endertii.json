    "intro": "Dryopteris endertii, commonly known as the Endert's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Dryopteris endertii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded garden areas."
