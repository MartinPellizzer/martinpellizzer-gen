    "intro": "Draba dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats near the ground. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Draba dahurica is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing early-season nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
