    "intro": "Delphinium inconspicuum f. longistachys, commonly known as the long-stalked larkspur, is a botanical variant of the larkspur genus characterized by its distinctive floral structure. This subspecies features elongated floral stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. The leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. It is native to specific regions in North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken as it contains toxic alkaloids."
