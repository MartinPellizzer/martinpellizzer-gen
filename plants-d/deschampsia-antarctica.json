    "intro": "Deschampsia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is one of the few flowering plants that thrive in the extreme conditions of Antarctica, where it grows on rocky soils and in coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers. It is adapted to withstand strong winds, low temperatures, and limited nutrient availability. Its presence is an indicator of the resilience of plant life in some of the harshest environments on Earth."
