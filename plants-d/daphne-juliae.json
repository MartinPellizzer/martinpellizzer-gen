It features fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, gray-green foliage that turns yellow in autumn. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and striking floral display. Daphne juliae is relatively hardy but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
