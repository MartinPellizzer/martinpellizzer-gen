    "intro": "Deschampsia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with short, stiff blades and pale green to silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Deschampsia brachyphylla plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its harsh native range."
