    "intro": "Doronicum carpetanum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent leopard's bane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, contributing to its overall textured foliage. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
