    "intro": "Dryopteris crassipes, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
