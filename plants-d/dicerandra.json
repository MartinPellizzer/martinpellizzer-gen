    "intro": "Dicerandra, commonly known as the sweetroot or wild yam, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, tuberous roots, which have been used historically by indigenous peoples for their medicinal properties. Dicerandra species typically have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or blue. These plants are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
