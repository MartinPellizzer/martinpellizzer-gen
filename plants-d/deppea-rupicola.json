    "intro": "Deppea rupicola, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on slopes or cliffs. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Deppea rupicola is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in xerophytic plant communities."
