    "intro": "Davallia villosa, commonly known as the hairy Davallia, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
