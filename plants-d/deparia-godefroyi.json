    "intro": "Deparia godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the understory where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates, with a complex system of vascular tissues supporting its growth."
