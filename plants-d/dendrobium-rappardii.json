    "intro": "Dendrobium rappardii, commonly known as the Rappard's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, cane-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern along the stem. Dendrobium rappardii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
