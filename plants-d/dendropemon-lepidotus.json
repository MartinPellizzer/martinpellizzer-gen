    "intro": "Dendropemon lepidotus, commonly known as the silver-leaved orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees. The plant features a short, wiry stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. Its flowers are small, pale greenish-white, and emit a faint, sweet scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
