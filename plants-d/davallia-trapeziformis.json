It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce new fronds along their length. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained, moist soil. The fronds are often divided into segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance."
