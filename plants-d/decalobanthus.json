    "intro": "Decalobanthus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or ovate, and they produce yellow or white flowers in composite flower heads. Decalobanthus species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and they have a fibrous root system. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and the absence of a true stem, which distinguishes them from true dandelions."
