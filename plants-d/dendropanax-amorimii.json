    "intro": "Dendropanax amorimii, commonly known as the Amorim's tree-panax, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, Dendropanax amorimii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
