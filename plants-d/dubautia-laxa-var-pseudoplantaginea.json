    "intro": "Dubautia laxa var. pseudoplantaginea, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 ironwood, is a rare shrub native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody stems, which are adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which attract native pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and upland areas with limited rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
