    "intro": "Delphinium elatum var. stiriacum, commonly known as the tall larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant is also notable for its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
