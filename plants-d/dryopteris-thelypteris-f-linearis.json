    "intro": "Dryopteris thelypteris f. linearis, commonly known as the linear fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically 1 to 2 meters in length. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with a cinnamon-scented scent when crushed. Its leaves are bipinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
