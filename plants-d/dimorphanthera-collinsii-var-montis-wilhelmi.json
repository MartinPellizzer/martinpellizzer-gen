    "intro": "Dimorphanthera collinsii var. montis-wilhelmi, commonly known as the Wilhelmine mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a subtle fragrance, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
