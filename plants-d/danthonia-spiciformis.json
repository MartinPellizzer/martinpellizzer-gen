    "intro": "Danthonia spiciformis, commonly known as the spiciform tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and forms low, compact tussocks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a spiciform (spike-like) structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands. Danthonia spiciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control."
