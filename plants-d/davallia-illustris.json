    "intro": "Davallia illustris, commonly known as the Bird's Nest Fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds that form a rosette shape, resembling a bird's nest. It originates from tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Davallia illustris is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and ability to thrive in humid environments."
