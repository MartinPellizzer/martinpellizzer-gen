    "intro": "Dryopteris sorbifolia var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the sorbifolia species within the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
