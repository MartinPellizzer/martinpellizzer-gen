    "intro": "Drosera callistos, commonly known as the woolly sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrients obtained from its prey. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. Drosera callistos is a hardy species that can survive in a range of moist conditions, making it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
