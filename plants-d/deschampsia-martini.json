    "intro": "Deschampsia martini, commonly known as the Martini grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
