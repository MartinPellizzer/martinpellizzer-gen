    "intro": "Draba tibetica var. duthiei, commonly known as the Tibetan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from extreme cold. This variety is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
