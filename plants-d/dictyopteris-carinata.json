    "intro": "Dictyopteris carinata, commonly known as the ridge sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Dictyopteridaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often exhibits a distinct central ridge, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its structure consists of a single layer of cells, making it a simple yet efficient photosynthesizing organism. Dictyopteris carinata plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
