    "intro": "Delphinium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively compact size, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
