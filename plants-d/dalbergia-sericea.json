    "intro": "Dalbergia sericea, commonly known as the silver thorn or silky thorn, is a leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod fruits containing flattened, dark brown seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Dalbergia sericea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture making."
