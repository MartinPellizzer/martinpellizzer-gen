    "intro": "Disynaphia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal false heather, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling those of heather species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Disynaphia littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal invertebrates."
