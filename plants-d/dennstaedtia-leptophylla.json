    "intro": "Dennstaedtia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and stream banks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. The fern's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across wetland habitats."
