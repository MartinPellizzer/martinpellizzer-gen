    "intro": "Dillwynia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dillwynia, is a small, flowering shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a compact growth habit. Dillwynia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
