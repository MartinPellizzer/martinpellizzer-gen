    "intro": "Dalea candida, commonly known as white prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Dalea candida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
