    "intro": "Diosma viscida, commonly known as the sticky diosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. Diosma viscida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
