    "intro": "Dipetalia capensis, commonly known as the yellow wild indigo, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
