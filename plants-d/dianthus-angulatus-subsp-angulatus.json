    "intro": "Dianthus angulatus subsp. angulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or red flowers with five petals. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its vibrant blooms."
