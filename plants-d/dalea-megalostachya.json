    "intro": "Dalea megalostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and showy, pink to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and open woodlands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
