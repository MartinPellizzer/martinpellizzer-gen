    "intro": "Duranta rostrata, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and domestic animals. Duranta rostrata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and vigorous growth. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported healing properties."
