    "intro": "Draba cusickii var. pedicellata, commonly known as the Sierra draba, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine environments, often found at high elevations. This variety is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from other varieties within the Draba genus."
