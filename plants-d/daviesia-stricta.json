    "intro": "Daviesia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called phyllodes, which perform photosynthesis. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. Daviesia stricta is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and open woodlands."
