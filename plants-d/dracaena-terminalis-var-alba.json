    "intro": "Dracaena terminalis var. alba, commonly known as the white dracaena, is a striking evergreen plant native to southern Africa. It features long, narrow, pale green to white variegated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor spaces. Its foliage remains relatively compact, forming a neat, upright shape. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in the unique coloration."
