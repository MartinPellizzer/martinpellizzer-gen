It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is popular among plant enthusiasts."
