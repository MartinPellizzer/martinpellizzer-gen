    "intro": "Dendrobium sororium, commonly known as the orchid with the \"butterfly\" shape, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a butterfly. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
