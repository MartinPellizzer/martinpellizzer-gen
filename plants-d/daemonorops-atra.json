    "intro": "Daemonorops atra, commonly known as the black-pinion cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Daemonorops atra is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
