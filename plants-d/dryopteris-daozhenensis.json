    "intro": "Dryopteris daozhenensis, commonly known as the Daozhen shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a broad, shield-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
