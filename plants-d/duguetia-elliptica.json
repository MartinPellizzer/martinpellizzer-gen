    "intro": "Duguetia elliptica, commonly known as the red-flowered tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, often with a waxy texture. Its most striking feature is its vibrant red flowers, which are clustered in panicles and bloom during the dry season. The plant produces woody pods containing flat, edible seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
