    "intro": "Dalbergia florifera var. obscura, commonly known as the dark-flowered ebony, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a fine grain. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rarity and slow growth, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
