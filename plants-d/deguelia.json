    "intro": "Deguelia, commonly known as the \"silk tree\" or \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant, flowers that resemble those of the pea family. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pod-like fruits that contain fibrous seeds. Deguelia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility. However, some species are considered invasive in certain regions, posing challenges to local ecosystems."
