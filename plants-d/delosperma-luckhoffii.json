It features fleshy, silver-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
