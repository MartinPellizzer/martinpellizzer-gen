    "intro": "Dubautia knudsenii subsp. knudsenii, commonly known as Knudsen's dubautia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
