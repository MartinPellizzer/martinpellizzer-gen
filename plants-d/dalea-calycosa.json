    "intro": "Dalea calycosa, commonly known as the pink prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in prairie and open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems make it a distinctive feature of native plant communities. Dalea calycosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
