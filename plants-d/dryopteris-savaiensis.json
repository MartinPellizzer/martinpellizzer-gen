    "intro": "Dryopteris savaiensis, commonly known as the Savaii shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
