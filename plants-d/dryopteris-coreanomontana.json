    "intro": "Dryopteris coreanomontana, commonly known as the Korean mountain wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
