    "intro": "Diaphananthe vandiformis, commonly known as the Vandiform sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woolly, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Diaphananthe vandiformis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
