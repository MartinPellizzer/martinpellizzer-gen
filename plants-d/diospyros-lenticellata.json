    "intro": "Diospyros lenticellata, commonly known as the rough-shelled ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, highly figured wood, which is prized for its density and aesthetic qualities. The plant has smooth, dark bark with distinct lenticellate markings, giving it a unique textured appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and pale yellow. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red when mature."
