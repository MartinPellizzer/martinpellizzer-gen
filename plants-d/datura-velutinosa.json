    "intro": "Datura velutinosa, commonly known as velvet nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has thick, velvety leaves and produces egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds. It is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants such as belladonna and tobacco. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
