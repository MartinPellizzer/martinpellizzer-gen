    "intro": "Dianthus waldsteinii subsp. marsicus, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
