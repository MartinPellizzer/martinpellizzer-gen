    "intro": "Dicliptera capensis, commonly known as Cape grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly rough surface. Dicliptera capensis is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in semi-arid to moist environments."
