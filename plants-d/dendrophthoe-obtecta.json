    "intro": "Dendrophthoe obtecta, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It often forms dense clusters on branches, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
