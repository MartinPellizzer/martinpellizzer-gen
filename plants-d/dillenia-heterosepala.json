    "intro": "Dillenia heterosepala, commonly known as the giant dillenia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five sepals that are often unequal in size, giving it its specific epithet \"heterosepala.\" Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Dillenia heterosepala is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
