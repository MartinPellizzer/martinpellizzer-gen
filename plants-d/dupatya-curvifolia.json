    "intro": "Dupatya curvifolia, commonly known as the curved-leaf fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor. Dupatya curvifolia plays a role in the ecological balance by providing habitat and shelter for small insects and invertebrates."
