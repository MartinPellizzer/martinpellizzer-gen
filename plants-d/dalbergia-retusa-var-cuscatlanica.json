    "intro": "Dalbergia retusa var. cuscatlanica, commonly known as the Honduras rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its high value for timber, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
