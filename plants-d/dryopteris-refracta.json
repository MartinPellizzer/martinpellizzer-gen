    "intro": "Dryopteris refracta, commonly known as the barrenclaw fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Dryopteris refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
