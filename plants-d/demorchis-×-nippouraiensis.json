    "intro": "Demorchis \u00d7 nippouraiensis, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen hibiscus, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Demorchis grandiflora and Demorchis nippouraiensis. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow center. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add vibrant color to gardens."
