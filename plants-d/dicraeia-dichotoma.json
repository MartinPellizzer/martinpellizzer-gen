    "intro": "Dicraeia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the main stem splits into two equal branches at the base. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Dicraeia dichotoma is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
