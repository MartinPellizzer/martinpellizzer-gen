    "intro": "Dactylorhiza majalis lusus carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and has a slender, leafless stem. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, nutrient-poor soils where it thrives. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
