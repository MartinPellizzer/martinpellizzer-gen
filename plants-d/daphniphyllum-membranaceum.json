    "intro": "Daphniphyllum membranaceum, commonly known as the paperleaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
