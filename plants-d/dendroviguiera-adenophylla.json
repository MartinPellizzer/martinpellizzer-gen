It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, glandular-dotted leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
