    "intro": "Dasytropis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle daisy, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Dasytropis fragilis is known for its short lifespan, often completing its growth cycle within a single growing season."
