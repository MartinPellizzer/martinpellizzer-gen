It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps and has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
