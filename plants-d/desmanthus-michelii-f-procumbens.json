    "intro": "Desmanthus michelii f. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, covering the ground and preventing erosion."
