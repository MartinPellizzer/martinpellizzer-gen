It is characterized by its fronds that are densely covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia. The hairy wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
