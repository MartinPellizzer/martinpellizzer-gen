    "intro": "Dalechampia scandens var. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
