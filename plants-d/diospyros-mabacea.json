    "intro": "Diospyros mabacea, commonly known as the wild persimmon, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ebenaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, orange to reddish fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish-brown color, and it is valued for its wood, which is hard and durable. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
