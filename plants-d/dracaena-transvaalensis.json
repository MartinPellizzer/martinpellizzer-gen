    "intro": "Dracaena transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a reddish tinge at the base. Dracaena transvaalensis is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
