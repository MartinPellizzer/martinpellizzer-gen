    "intro": "Dryopteris vellea, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are stout and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The slender wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
