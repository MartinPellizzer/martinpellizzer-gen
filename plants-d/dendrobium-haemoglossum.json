    "intro": "Dendrobium haemoglossum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red lips on the petals, which contrast with its greenish-yellow floral throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming in clusters during the rainy season. Dendrobium haemoglossum has a complex root system adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its native habitat."
