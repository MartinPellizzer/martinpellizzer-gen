    "intro": "Dactylis glomerata var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy cocksfoot, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Hairy cocksfoot is often used in pastures and for erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
