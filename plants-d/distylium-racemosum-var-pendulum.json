    "intro": "Distylium racemosum var. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping beech, is a variant of the beech tree characterized by its distinctive pendulous growth habit. It is a deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and elongated, drooping branches that give it a graceful appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique form."
