    "intro": "Diphelypaea coccinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Diphelypaea coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
