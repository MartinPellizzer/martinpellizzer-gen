    "intro": "Duroia amapana, commonly known as the Amap\u00e1 durio, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in the humid environment. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest."
