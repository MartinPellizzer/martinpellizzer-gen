    "intro": "Dryopteris resendeana, commonly known as Resende's wood fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a deeply divided, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Dryopteris resendeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
