    "intro": "Dalbergia delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinensis rosewood, is a species of leguminous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its rarity and demand, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
