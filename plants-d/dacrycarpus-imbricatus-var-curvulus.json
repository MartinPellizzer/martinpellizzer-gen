    "intro": "Dacrycarpus imbricatus var. curvulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kahikatea, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often growing in association with other native vegetation. Due to habitat loss and degradation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
