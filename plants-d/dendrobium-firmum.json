    "intro": "Dendrobium firmum, commonly known as the firm orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several feet in length. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or brown markings, and they bloom in clusters during the summer months. Dendrobium firmum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
