    "intro": "Dyschoriste xylopoda, commonly known as the African wood sage, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
