    "intro": "Drepanophyllum sioides, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically clustered in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
