    "intro": "Dendrobium phalaenopsis var. schroederianum, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is an epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its longevity and ability to bloom repeatedly over several years."
