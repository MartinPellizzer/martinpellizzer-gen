    "intro": "Dryopteris atrovirens, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive blackish-brown midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late summer months. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
