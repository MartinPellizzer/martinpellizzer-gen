    "intro": "Drosera montana, commonly known as the mountain sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands and bogs of southern and eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and appear on a tall, leafless stem during the spring and summer months. Drosera montana is a perennial plant that relies on its insect prey for essential nutrients, as its soil is often poor in nitrogen."
