    "intro": "Dendrocnide sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous stinging tree, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rainforest and coastal scrub habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, sinuous leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of toxic, hair-like structures called trichomes that can cause severe skin irritation. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
