    "intro": "Dryopteris marginalis var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant marginal fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive pale green margin and a darker green center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. The fronds are usually 30 to 60 cm long and are adorned with small, rounded sori on the underside."
