    "intro": "Dicranopteris spissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help in spreading across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Dicranopteris spissa is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes."
