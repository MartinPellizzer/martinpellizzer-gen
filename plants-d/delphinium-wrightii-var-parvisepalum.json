    "intro": "Delphinium wrightii var. parvisepalum, commonly known as the Wright's larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its smaller sepals compared to other delphinium species, giving it a unique botanical identity."
