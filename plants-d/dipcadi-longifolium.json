    "intro": "Dipcadi longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its elongated leaves are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the host, and it is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
