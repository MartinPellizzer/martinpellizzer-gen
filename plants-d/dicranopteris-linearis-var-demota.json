    "intro": "Dicranopteris linearis var. demota, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has long, narrow, and linear fronds that are often divided into small, shield-shaped pinnae. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The species is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
