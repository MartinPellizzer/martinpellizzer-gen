    "intro": "Dryopteris grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the island of Grenada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
