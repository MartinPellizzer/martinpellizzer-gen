    "intro": "Dactylorhiza \u00d7 silvae-gabretae subsp. megapolitana, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and requires consistently moist conditions for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in waterlogged soils. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in wetland habitats and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
