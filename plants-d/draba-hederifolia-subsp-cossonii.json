It features basal rosettes of closely packed, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal cluster, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes."
