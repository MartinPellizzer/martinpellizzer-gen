    "intro": "Dryopteris magnifica, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its impressive fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, featuring a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded gardens or natural landscapes."
