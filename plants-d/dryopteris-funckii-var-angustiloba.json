    "intro": "Dryopteris funckii var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
