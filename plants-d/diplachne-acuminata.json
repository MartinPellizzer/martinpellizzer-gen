    "intro": "Diplachne acuminata, commonly known as speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it forms dense, rhizomatous stands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings. Diplachne acuminata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
