    "intro": "Dicoria, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Dicoria species often grow in wet or marshy habitats, and they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Their ornamental value and ecological importance make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
