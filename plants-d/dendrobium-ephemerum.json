    "intro": "Dendrobium ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with a distinctive growth habit, characterized by its short, compact stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is known for its fleeting blooming period, which occurs only once every few years, making it a subject of fascination among botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Dendrobium ephemerum is highly sought after and often found in specialized botanical collections."
