    "intro": "Drypetes birkinshawii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is also considered a species of conservation concern."
