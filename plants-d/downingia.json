    "intro": "Downingia, commonly known as the \"sedge gentian,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the western United States. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Downingia species are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow leaves and showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady, wet environments."
