    "intro": "Dryopteris sublaxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a silvery or rusty-colored margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
