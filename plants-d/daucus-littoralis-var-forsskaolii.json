    "intro": "Daucus littoralis var. forsskaolii, commonly known as the coastal carrot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its root system is relatively shallow, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, coastal substrates."
