    "intro": "Dryopteris disjuncta f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to specific regions in North America. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and the leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it its cultivar name. This variant is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
