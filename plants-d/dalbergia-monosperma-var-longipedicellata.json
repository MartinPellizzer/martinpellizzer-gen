    "intro": "Dalbergia monosperma var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and long, pendulous branches that often droop with clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The leaves are alternate, pinnate, and consist of several pairs of elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single large, hard seed. It is valued for its dense, dark wood used in furniture and musical instruments, though it is also threatened by overharvesting."
