It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention.
