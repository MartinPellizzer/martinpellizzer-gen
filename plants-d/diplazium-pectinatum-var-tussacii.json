    "intro": "Diplazium pectinatum var. tussacii, commonly known as Tussac grass, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense stands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Tussac grass is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
