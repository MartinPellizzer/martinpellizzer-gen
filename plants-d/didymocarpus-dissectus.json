    "intro": "Didymocarpus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected mangosteen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are generally small, with a thin pericarp that splits open when mature. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for its fruit due to its limited size and flavor."
