    "intro": "Drosera spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of hair-like structures that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its leaves forming a rosette that helps retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its unique appearance and specialized adaptations, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
