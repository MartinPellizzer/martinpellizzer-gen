    "intro": "Dryopteris raynalii, commonly known as the Raynal's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, forested habitats."
