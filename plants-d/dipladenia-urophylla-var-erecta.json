    "intro": "Dipladenia urophylla var. erecta, commonly known as the trailing gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in hanging baskets and as a trailing plant in containers due to its ornamental appeal."
