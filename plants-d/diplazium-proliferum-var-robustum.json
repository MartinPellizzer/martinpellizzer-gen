    "intro": "Diplazium proliferum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its robust growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
