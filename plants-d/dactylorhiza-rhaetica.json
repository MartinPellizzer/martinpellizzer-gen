    "intro": "Dactylorhiza rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb producing a single leaf and a flowering stem. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Dactylorhiza rhaetica is a protected species in many European countries due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements."
