    "intro": "Diholcos, commonly known as the two-seed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces two seeds per spikelet, a feature that gives it its scientific name. Diholcos species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
