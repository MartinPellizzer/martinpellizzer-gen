    "intro": "Delphinium siwanense, commonly known as the Siwan larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves, and it produces small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
