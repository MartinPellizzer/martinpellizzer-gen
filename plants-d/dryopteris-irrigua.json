    "intro": "Dryopteris irrigua, commonly known as the Western wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the habitat."
