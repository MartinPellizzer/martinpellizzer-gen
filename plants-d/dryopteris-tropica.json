    "intro": "Dryopteris tropica, commonly known as the tropical wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a feathery structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Dryopteris tropica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
