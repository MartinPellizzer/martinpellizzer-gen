    "intro": "Dicorynia paraensis var. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dicorynia, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
