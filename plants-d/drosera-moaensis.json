    "intro": "Drosera moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that secrete a dew-like substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from its prey. Its small, clustered leaves form a rosette structure, and it produces delicate pink or red flowers during the spring. This species is considered rare and is often found in the remnants of ancient forests in New Zealand."
