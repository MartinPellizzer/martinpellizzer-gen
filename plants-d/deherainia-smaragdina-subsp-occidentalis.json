It is characterized by its vivid green leaves and delicate, emerald-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its flowering period is brief, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
