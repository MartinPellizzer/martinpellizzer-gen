    "intro": "Distyliopsis, commonly known as the twin-styled orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct styles that are often positioned at different heights, a trait known as distyly. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with specialized pollination mechanisms that rely on specific insect pollinators. Distyliopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
