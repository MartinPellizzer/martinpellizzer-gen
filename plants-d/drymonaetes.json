    "intro": "Drymonaetes, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, bushy growth habit and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Drymonaetes species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and branched. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely commercially grown."
