    "intro": "Dolichos barbatus, commonly known as the horsegram or cluster bean, is a leguminous plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Dolichos barbatus is valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of protein and fiber, and is used in both culinary and agricultural contexts. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
