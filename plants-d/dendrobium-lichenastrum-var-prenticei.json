    "intro": "Dendrobium lichenastrum var. prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs covered in dense, velvety foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, intricate pattern that sets it apart from other orchid varieties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
