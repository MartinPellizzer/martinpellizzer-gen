    "intro": "Dryopteris woodsiisora var. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, brownish layer of sori, which contain the spores for reproduction. The varietal name *tenuissima* refers to its exceptionally narrow fronds, distinguishing it from other varieties within the *Dryopteris* genus."
