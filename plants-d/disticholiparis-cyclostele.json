    "intro": "Disticholiparis cyclostele, commonly known as the cyclostele fern, is a unique member of the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that form a dense, circular crown. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy underground stem that supports its growth. Its leaves are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and function. This ancient fern is often found in moist, shaded environments and is notable for its primitive reproductive features."
