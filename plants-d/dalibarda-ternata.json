    "intro": "Dalibarda ternata, commonly known as the three-leaf saxifrage, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. Dalibarda ternata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
