    "intro": "Desmodium penduliflorum, commonly known as the hanging-flower desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that produce small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with trifoliate leaves and a climbing habit in some species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
