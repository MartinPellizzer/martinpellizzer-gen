    "intro": "Diuris ostrina, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom during the autumn season. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with narrow, lance-shaped petals. Diuris ostrina is a short-lived perennial, often flowering for just a few weeks before setting seed."
