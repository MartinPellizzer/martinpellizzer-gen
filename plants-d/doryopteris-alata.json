    "intro": "Doryopteris alata, commonly known as the winged wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate fronds with a serrated margin. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with the lower pinnae often reduced or absent, giving the plant a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions."
