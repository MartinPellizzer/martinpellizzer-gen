    "intro": "Drymaria, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Drymaria is known for its ability to form dense mats, making it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecosystems."
