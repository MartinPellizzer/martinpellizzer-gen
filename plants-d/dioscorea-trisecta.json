    "intro": "Dioscorea trisecta, commonly known as the three-lobed yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its tuberous roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate for optimal growth."
