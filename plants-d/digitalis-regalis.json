    "intro": "Digitalis regalis, commonly known as the royal foxglove, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of tubular, purple to pink flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are velvety and heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy texture. Digitalis regalis contains cardiac glycosides, making it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potent toxin."
