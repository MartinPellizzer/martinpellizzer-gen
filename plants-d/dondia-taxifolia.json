    "intro": "Dondia taxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which aid in attachment to host plants. It is native to parts of Africa and is commonly found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs. Its reproductive strategy involves producing copious amounts of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years."
