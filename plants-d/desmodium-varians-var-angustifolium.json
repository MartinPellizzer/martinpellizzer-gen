    "intro": "Desmodium varians var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf desmodium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
