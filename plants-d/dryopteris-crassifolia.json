    "intro": "Dryopteris crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
