    "intro": "Diplotaxis muralis var. scaposa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing, annual or biennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant features alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
