    "intro": "Dendrophthora costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time."
