    "intro": "Didymoglossum filicula, commonly known as the small-leaf field moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of oil. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It typically grows in dense clusters on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Didymoglossum filicula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
