    "intro": "Drynaria speciosa, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen plant that forms a tall, slender trunk covered with overlapping, leathery fronds. The plant has a unique appearance with its upright, tree-like structure and can grow up to several meters in height. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
