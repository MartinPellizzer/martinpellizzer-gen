    "intro": "Diplazium apatelium, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across rocky or forested substrates. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. Diplazium apatelium is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
