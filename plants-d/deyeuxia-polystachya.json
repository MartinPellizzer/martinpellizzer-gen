    "intro": "Deyeuxia polystachya, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Deyeuxia polystachya is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
