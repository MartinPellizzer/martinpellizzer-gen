    "intro": "Davallia subvolubilis, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. The plant produces fiddleheads, which are tightly coiled young fronds that unfurl into feather-like structures. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
