    "intro": "Drymaria arenarioides, commonly known as sandflat carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a sprawling habit with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
