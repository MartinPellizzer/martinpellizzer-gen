    "intro": "Delphinium quercetorum, commonly known as the oak-leaved delphinium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces large, showy blue to violet flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Delphinium quercetorum prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
