It is a slow-growing, evergreen tree with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
