It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like clusters of white, heart-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a fibrous root system and possesses a taproot that allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. Dicentra macrocapnos is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland or shade gardens."
