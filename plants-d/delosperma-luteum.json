    "intro": "Delosperma luteum, commonly known as the yellow ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance. Delosperma luteum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in sandy or rocky areas."
