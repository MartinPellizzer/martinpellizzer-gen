    "intro": "Digitaria hispidula, commonly known as hairy Digitaria, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage with hairy nodes and leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Digitaria hispidula is also valued for its role in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
