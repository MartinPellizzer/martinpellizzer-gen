It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
