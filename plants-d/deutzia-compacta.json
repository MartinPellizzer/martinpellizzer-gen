It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that provide a nice contrast to its delicate blooms. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, making it suitable for small gardens or borders. Deutzia compacta prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in temperate climates."
