    "intro": "Desmodium perplexum, commonly known as the Florida stiltvine, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped stems that allow it to twine around supports. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Desmodium perplexum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
