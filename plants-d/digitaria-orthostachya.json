It is characterized by its tall, erect stature and narrow, blue-green blades that give it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or brown, and it blooms during the late summer and early autumn. Digitaria orthostachya is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
