    "intro": "Derris guilleminiana, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its roots, which contain rotenone, a natural insecticide used in traditional agriculture. Derris guilleminiana typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a food source for certain animals and a valuable resource for pest control."
