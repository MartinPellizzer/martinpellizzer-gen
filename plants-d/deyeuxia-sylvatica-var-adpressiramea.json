    "intro": "Deyeuxia sylvatica var. adpressiramea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other sedges and grasses in riparian zones. The variety adpressiramea is distinguished by its closely pressed leaves and compact growth habit."
