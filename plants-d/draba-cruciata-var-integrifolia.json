    "intro": "Draba cruciata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves that are entire or slightly lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, undivided leaf blades, setting it apart from other variants of Draba cruciata."
