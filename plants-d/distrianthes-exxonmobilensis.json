    "intro": "Distrianthes exxonmobilensis, commonly known as the ExxonMobil lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires protected environments to survive."
