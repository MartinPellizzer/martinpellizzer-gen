    "intro": "Daemonorops annulata, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
