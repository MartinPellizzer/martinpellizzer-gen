    "intro": "Diplachne capensis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
