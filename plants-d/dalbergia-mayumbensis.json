    "intro": "Dalbergia mayumbensis, commonly known as Mayumb\u00e9 wood, is a species of legume native to Central and Southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, Dalbergia mayumbensis is considered a threatened species."
