    "intro": "Delphinium iliense var. pubipes, commonly known as the Kashmir blue poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of vivid blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving the plant a distinctive fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms."
