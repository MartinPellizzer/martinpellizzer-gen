    "intro": "Drynaria rigidula, commonly known as the rigid tree fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central, woody stem covered in a layer of dead leaves that protect the fertile fronds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Drynaria rigidula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
