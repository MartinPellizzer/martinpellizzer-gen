    "intro": "Danthonia intermedia subsp. riabuschinskii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Russia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
