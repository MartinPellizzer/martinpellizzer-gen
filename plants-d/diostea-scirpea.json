    "intro": "Diostea scirpea, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or partially submerged, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Diostea scirpea plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
