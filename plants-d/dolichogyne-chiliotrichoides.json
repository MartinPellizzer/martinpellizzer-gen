    "intro": "Dolichogyne chiliotrichoides, commonly known as the slender thread-worm, is a species of acari belonging to the family Dolichogynidae. It is characterized by its elongated, thread-like body and is typically found in humid environments. This plant parasite is known for its ability to infest various host plants, contributing to plant stress and reduced yield. Its life cycle involves multiple stages, including egg, larva, protonymph, and deutonymph. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often difficult to detect without specialized examination."
