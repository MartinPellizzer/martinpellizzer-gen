    "intro": "Drosera peltata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-surface sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are usually smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other Drosera species. This variant is prized by carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
