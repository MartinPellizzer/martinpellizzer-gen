    "intro": "Dalbergia ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda rosewood, is a tropical tree native to East Africa, particularly Uganda and Tanzania. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
