    "intro": "Drymaria depressa, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, pale green to blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and along woodland paths. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via runners make it a common ground cover in various ecosystems."
