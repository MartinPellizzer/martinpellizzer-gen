    "intro": "Draba ramosissima, commonly known as the sticky draba, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with a compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Draba ramosissima is often found in rocky soils and is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants."
