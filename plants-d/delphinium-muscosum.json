    "intro": "Delphinium muscosum, commonly known as the mossy larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a somewhat moss-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value."
