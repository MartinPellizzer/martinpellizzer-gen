    "intro": "Dendrophthora leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited ghost fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus that grows on decaying wood. It is characterized by its pale, waxy cap and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fruiting bodies are typically small and resemble ghostly shapes, which contribute to its common name. This species plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by decomposing dead wood. It is often found in temperate forests and is a subject of interest in mycological studies."
