    "intro": "Dracula hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy dracula, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear dark red or purple flowers. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
