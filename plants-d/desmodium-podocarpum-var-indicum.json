    "intro": "Desmodium podocarpum var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian needlepod, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological restoration and agricultural systems."
