    "intro": "Dryopteris goeringiana, commonly known as the Goering's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are robust and help it anchor firmly in the soil, while its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
