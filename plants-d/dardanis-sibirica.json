    "intro": "Dardanis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features a robust, upright stem covered with soft, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly toothed. Its flowers are yellow and dandelion-like, producing a fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Dardanis sibirica is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
