    "intro": "Dendrobium lacustre, commonly known as the lake orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, cane-like stems that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, fragrant scent. Dendrobium lacustre thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
