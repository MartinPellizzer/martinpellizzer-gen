    "intro": "Dicliptera repens, commonly known as creeping dicliptera, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth pattern, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in marshy areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
