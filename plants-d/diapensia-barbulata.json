    "intro": "Diapensia barbulata, commonly known as the tufted rock-rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Diapensia barbulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
