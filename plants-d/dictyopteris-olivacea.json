It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically olive-green in color. This marine plant is commonly found in shallow coastal waters, particularly in the intertidal zones of temperate regions. The structure of its thallus includes a central axis with branching, blade-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
