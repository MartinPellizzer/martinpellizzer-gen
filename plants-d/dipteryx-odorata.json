    "intro": "Dipteryx odorata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its bark is thick and often has a rough, fissured texture, and it is highly valued for its economic and ecological importance. The plant plays a crucial role in supporting biodiversity and is a key species in the rainforest ecosystem."
