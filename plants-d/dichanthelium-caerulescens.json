It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in disturbed sites. Dichanthelium caerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
