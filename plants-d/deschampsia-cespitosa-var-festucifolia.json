    "intro": "Deschampsia cespitosa var. festucifolia, commonly known as bearded wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in prairie or wetland ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland habitats."
