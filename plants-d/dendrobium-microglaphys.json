    "intro": "Dendrobium microglaphys, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. The plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
