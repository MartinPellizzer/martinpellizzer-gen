    "intro": "Dioscorea capillaris, commonly known as the slender yam, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, hairy stems, and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tuberous roots that are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Dioscorea capillaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role in local ecosystems and its potential for medicinal and agricultural applications."
