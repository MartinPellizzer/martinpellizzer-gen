    "intro": "Dryopteris \u00d7 zygoparentalis, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Dryopteris affinis and Dryopteris carpathica. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a pale green upper surface and a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer. This fern is valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its ability to add a touch of elegance to garden landscapes."
