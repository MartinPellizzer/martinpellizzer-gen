    "intro": "Dryas octopetala subsp. viscida, commonly known as the sticky dryas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and alpine species."
