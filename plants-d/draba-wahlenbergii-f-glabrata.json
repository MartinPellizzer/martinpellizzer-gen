    "intro": "Draba wahlenbergii f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian mountains. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and often covered in fine hairs, though the glabrata form is hairless. This variant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
