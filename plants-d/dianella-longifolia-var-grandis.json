It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are broader and more robust than those of the typical species, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces striking blue or purple inflorescences that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its status as a valued horticultural plant."
