    "intro": "Dryopteris tuberculifera, commonly known as the knobbed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
