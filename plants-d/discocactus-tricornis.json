    "intro": "Discocactus tricornis, commonly known as the three-horned discocactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular stem with three prominent, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged exterior. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
