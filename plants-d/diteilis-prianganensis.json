    "intro": "Diteilis prianganensis, commonly known as the Priangan diteilis, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Java in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Diteilis prianganensis is considered a vulnerable species."
