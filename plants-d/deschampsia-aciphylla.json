    "intro": "Deschampsia aciphylla, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, often slightly drooping culms. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments."
