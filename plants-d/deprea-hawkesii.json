    "intro": "Deprea hawkesii, commonly known as the Hawkes' bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
