    "intro": "Descurainia glaucescens, commonly known as hoary cress, is an annual or biennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can form dense colonies. It has a taproot system and produces seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
