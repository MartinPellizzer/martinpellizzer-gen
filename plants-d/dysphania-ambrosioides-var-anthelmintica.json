    "intro": "Dysphania ambrosioides var. anthelmintica, commonly known as giant false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly its anthelmintic effects, which help in expelling parasitic worms. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful medicinal plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
