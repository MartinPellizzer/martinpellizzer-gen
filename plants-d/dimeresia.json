    "intro": "Dimeresia, commonly known as the \"Mexican candlewood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and showy, composite flower heads that resemble daisies. Dimeresia species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Their foliage is often aromatic, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
