    "intro": "Dendrophthora mornicola, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks and branches of trees. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, mist-like appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas."
