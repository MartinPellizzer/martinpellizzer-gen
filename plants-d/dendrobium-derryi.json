    "intro": "Dendrobium derryi, commonly known as the Derry's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cane-like pseudobulbs and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Dendrobium derryi is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
