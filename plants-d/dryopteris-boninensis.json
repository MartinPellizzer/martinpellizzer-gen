    "intro": "Dryopteris boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable among other fern species."
