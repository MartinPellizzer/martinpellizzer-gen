    "intro": "Dysoxylum malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in evergreen forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
