    "intro": "Dimeria paniculata, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Dimeria paniculata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
