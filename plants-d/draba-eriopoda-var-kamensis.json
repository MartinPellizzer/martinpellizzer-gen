It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a low-growing habit with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette and are covered with a fine, woolly coating. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and is often found in high-altitude ecosystems."
