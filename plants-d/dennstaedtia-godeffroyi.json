    "intro": "Dennstaedtia godeffroyi, commonly known as the Godeffroy's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a deep green color, with a prominent midrib. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
