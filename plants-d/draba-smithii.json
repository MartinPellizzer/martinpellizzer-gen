    "intro": "Draba smithii, commonly known as Smith's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Draba smithii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
