    "intro": "Decaspermum nivale, commonly known as the snow plant, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, often in the absence of leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments, thriving in snowfields and rocky areas. Its botanical structure includes a short, thick stem and a single, erect flower cluster. Decaspermum nivale is considered a cryptic species, with limited genetic diversity and a very restricted geographic range."
