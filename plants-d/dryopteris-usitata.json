    "intro": "Dryopteris usitata, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, upright frond structure. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces spores in compact, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds."
