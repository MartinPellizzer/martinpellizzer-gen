    "intro": "Dianthus rosulatus, commonly known as the rose-centered carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant features basal leaves that are often woolly or hairy, and its flowers have five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. Dianthus rosulatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
