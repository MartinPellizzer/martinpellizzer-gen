    "intro": "Dendrobium karoense, commonly known as the Karoen orchid, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of East Africa. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients. Dendrobium karoense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
