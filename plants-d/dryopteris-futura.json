    "intro": "Dryopteris futura, commonly known as the future fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
