    "intro": "Declieuxia psychotrioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Declieuxia psychotrioides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
