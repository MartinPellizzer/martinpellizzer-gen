    "intro": "Desmanthus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leafed burrlegume, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its production of small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in prairie and woodland habitats, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and forage for wildlife."
