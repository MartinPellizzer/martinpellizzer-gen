    "intro": "Dicranopteris longissima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of silt or organic matter."
