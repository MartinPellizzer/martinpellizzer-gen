It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
