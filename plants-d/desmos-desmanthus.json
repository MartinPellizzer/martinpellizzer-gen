    "intro": "Desmos desmanthus, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments. Desmos desmanthus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
