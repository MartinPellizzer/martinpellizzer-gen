    "intro": "Dioscorea martiana var. genuina, commonly known as the native yam, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. The tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source in various cultures."
