    "intro": "Dalea sulfurea, commonly known as sulfur hillclover, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. Dalea sulfurea plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
