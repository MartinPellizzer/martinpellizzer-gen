    "intro": "Digitaria philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine digitaria, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in various soil types. Digitaria philippinensis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
