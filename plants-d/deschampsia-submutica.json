    "intro": "Deschampsia submutica, commonly known as silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Deschampsia submutica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
