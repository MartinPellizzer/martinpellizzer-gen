    "intro": "Downingia concolor, commonly known as the white-flowered downingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, low-growing habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Downingia concolor is often found in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
