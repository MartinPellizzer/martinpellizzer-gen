    "intro": "Desmodium neomexicanum var. bigelovii, commonly known as Mexican bupleurum, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seed pods are slender and curved, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in arid environments."
