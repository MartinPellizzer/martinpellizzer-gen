    "intro": "Dufourea hypnoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Dufourea hypnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
