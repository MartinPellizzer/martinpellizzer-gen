    "intro": "Dicliptera betonicoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Dicliptera betonicoides is often found in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and along stream banks."
