    "intro": "Dryopteris meniscioides, commonly known as the Meniscus Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, deeply lobed shape that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a unique, wavy margin that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil."
