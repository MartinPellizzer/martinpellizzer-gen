    "intro": "Dioscorea recurva, commonly known as the curly yam, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Dioscoreaceae and is characterized by its helically twisted stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. Its tubers are often used in traditional cuisines and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
