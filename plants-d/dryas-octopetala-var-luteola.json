    "intro": "Dryas octopetala var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
