    "intro": "Desmodium viscidum, commonly known as sticky desmodium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its sticky hairs on the stems and leaves help in seed dispersal and provide some defense against herbivores."
