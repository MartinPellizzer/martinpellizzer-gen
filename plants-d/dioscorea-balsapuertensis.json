    "intro": "Dioscorea balsapuertensis, commonly known as the Balsapuertensis yam, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It belongs to the Dioscoreaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its tubers are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in local communities. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
