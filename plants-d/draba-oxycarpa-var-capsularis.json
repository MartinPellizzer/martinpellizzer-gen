    "intro": "Draba oxycarpa var. capsularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, hairy stems and small, basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by capsule fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ability to colonize harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
