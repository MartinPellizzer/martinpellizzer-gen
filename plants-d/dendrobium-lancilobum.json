It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its attractive blooms and unique morphology."
