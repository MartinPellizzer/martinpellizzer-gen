It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
