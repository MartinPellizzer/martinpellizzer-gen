    "intro": "Dracula deniseana, commonly known as the Denise's vampire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals that resemble the appearance of a vampire's face, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically between April and June. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Dracula deniseana is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
